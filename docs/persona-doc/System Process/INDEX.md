# System Processes — Carmen Inventory

This folder documents **what the system does** underneath each transaction, across three cross-cutting processes. It complements the persona workflow docs (01–05) which describe *what users do*.

**Output location:** `/Users/peak/Storage/1-Projects/Carmen/System-Processes/`

## How to Use This Folder

| If you want to know… | Read… |
|---|---|
| How inventory qty changes for a specific transaction | The transaction doc (tx-XX) → System Effects table |
| The rules that govern AVCO vs FIFO cost recalculation | `proc-03-cost-calculation.md` |
| Which transactions create or consume lots | `proc-02-lot-management.md` |
| Which location types are affected by a transaction | The transaction doc → System Effects table |
| How End Period Close relates to Physical Count and Spot Check | `tx-09-end-period-close.md` + `tx-08-physical-stocktake.md` + `tx-10-spot-check.md` |

---

## Scope and Constraints

| Constraint | Value |
|---|---|
| Costing method | AVCO or FIFO — set per Business Unit at implementation; **cannot be changed after go-live** |
| Lot tracking scope | **Inventory locations only** — Direct and Consignment locations are excluded |
| Lot granularity | 1 lot = 1 inventory location (a lot cannot span multiple locations) |
| Location types | Inventory · Direct · Consignment |
| End Period prerequisite | Stage 1: all transactions (GRN/ADJ/TRF/SR/WR) Posted · Stage 2: all Spot Checks Completed · Stage 3: all Physical Counts Finalized (GL posted) |
| Physical Count lock | Transactions at a location are locked while its Physical Count is IN PROGRESS |

## Process Execution Swim Lane

The diagram below shows the order in which processes execute for each transaction group. Columns are the four processes; rows are the transaction groups.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant TX as Transaction
    participant INV as ① Inventory Update
    participant LOT as ② Lot Management
    participant COST as ③ Cost Calculation
    participant PERIOD as ④ Period Control

    Note over TX,COST: Stock-in — GRN · Stock In (adj)
    TX->>INV: +qty at inventory location
    INV->>LOT: New lot created at inv location
    LOT->>COST: AVCO re-average / FIFO add cost layer

    Note over TX,COST: Stock-out — CRN · Issues · Sales Consumption · Stock Out (adj) · WR (Wastage Report)
    TX->>INV: -qty at inventory location
    INV->>LOT: Oldest lot consumed / closed
    LOT->>COST: AVCO cost held / FIFO oldest layer consumed

    Note over TX,COST: SR — Store Requisition (internal transfer)
    TX->>INV: -qty inv source / +qty direct or consignment dest
    INV->>LOT: Lot consumed at inv source — no lot at destination
    Note over COST: NOT triggered — goods move at existing cost

    Note over TX,PERIOD: Physical Stocktake
    TX->>INV: variance qty (stocktake transaction type)
    INV->>LOT: Lots adjusted up or down at inv location
    LOT->>COST: Recalc only if variance exists
    COST->>PERIOD: All locations complete — End Period Close unlocked

    Note over TX,PERIOD: End Period Close
    TX->>INV: Period snapshot recorded
    INV->>LOT: Open lots closed for the period
    LOT->>COST: Period costs locked — no backdated entries
    COST->>PERIOD: New period opened

## Transaction × Process Matrix

✅ = process triggered · ❌ = not triggered · — = not applicable

| Transaction | Inventory Update | Lot Management | Cost Calculation | End Period Close |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GRN (Goods Receipt Note) | ✅ +qty at inv | ✅ new lot (inv only) | ✅ AVCO/FIFO recalc | — |
| CRN (Credit Return Note) | ✅ −qty at inv | ✅ reverse lot | ✅ AVCO/FIFO recalc | — |
| SR (Store Requisition) | ✅ −qty inv source / +qty at dest | ✅ consume lot at inv source; new lot at inv dest (Variant A only) | ❌ transfer at existing FIFO cost | — |
| Issues | ✅ −qty at inv | ✅ consume lot | ✅ AVCO/FIFO recalc | — |
| Sales Consumption (SC) | ✅ −qty at inv | ✅ consume lot | ✅ AVCO/FIFO recalc | — |
| Stock In (adj) | ✅ +qty at inv | ✅ new lot (inv only) | ✅ AVCO/FIFO recalc | — |
| Stock Out (adj) | ✅ −qty at inv | ✅ consume lot (inv only) | ✅ AVCO/FIFO recalc | — |
| WR (Wastage Report) | ✅ −qty at inv (INV/CON); metrics only at DIR | ✅ consume lot (inv only) | ✅ AVCO/FIFO recalc (INV/CON only) | — |
| Spot Check | ⏳ PENDING — variance posting not yet implemented | ⏳ PENDING | ⏳ PENDING | — |
| Physical Count | ✅ ±qty (variance) | ✅ adjust lots | ✅ recalc if qty changes | — |
| End Period Close | ✅ period snapshot | ✅ close open lots | ✅ lock period costs | ✅ |

> **SR note:** SR has 3 destination variants: INV → INV (= Stock Transfer view, balance-sheet only), INV → DIR (Dr Expense / Cr Inventory Asset), INV → CONS (Dr Expense / Cr Vendor Liability). FIFO cost-layer consumption at source; Cost Calculation (proc-03) not triggered for any variant. See [tx-03-sr.md](tx-03-sr.md).

> **WR note:** Wastage Report is a separate transaction with its own document and approval workflow (see [tx-11-wastage-report.md](tx-11-wastage-report.md)). On approval, it generates a downstream Stock Out adjustment that appears in the inventory ledger under reference type `WR`. WR ≠ ADJ — WR is the operational/evidence layer (photos, tiered approval, supplier charge-back) that *produces* an ADJ.

> **TRF note:** There is no separate Transfer transaction entity. Stock Transfer is a read-only filtered view of SR records where both source and destination are INVENTORY locations. In period-close Stage 1, SR with INV → INV destinations satisfies both the SR and TRF buckets. Source: BR-stock-transfers.md.

> **Spot Check note:** Variance posting to inventory is PENDING (not yet implemented per BR-spot-check.md v2.2.0). Spot Checks currently reach `completed` status and satisfy End Period Close Stage 2, but do not post QOH / lot / cost changes.

> **Physical Count note:** Variance is posted as its own transaction type (not a Stock In/Out adjustment). Physical Count must reach **Finalized** status (GL posted) to satisfy End Period Close Stage 3 — Completed alone is insufficient.
