# Platform Administration — Identity & Access

The **Platform Administrator** is the system-owner persona for Carmen Inventory. They operate inside the **System Admin** area (`/system-admin/*`) and are responsible for *who can do what, where*. Three modules make up their Identity & Access toolkit:

- **Role & Permissions** — define reusable permission bundles (a role is a name plus a set of granted `resource.action` permissions across categories like Configuration, Procurement, Inventory).
- **User Management** — assign those roles to existing people, review their department membership, and grant the locations they can operate at. (There is no "create user" screen — users already exist; the admin *assigns* access.)
- **Workflow Configuration** — design the approval chains (stages, assigned users / HOD routing, actions, SLAs) that documents such as Purchase Requests and Purchase Orders flow through.

These three are sequential by intent: an administrator first **defines a role**, then **assigns it to a user** (alongside departments/locations), and finally **wires that user into the workflow stages** where their authority applies.

Access requires System Admin rights. Unauthenticated visitors are redirected to `/login`; authenticated users without the right permissions are blocked from every module.

## Workflow Overview

```mermaid
graph TD
    role["1. Role & Permissions<br/>define permission bundle"] --> user["2. User Management<br/>assign role + locations"]
    user --> wf["3. Workflow Configuration<br/>place user in approval stages"]
    role -.->|roles referenced by| user
    user -.->|assignable users| wf
    wf --> live(["Workflow ready / active"])
```

The dotted edges show the data dependencies: roles defined in module 1 are the cards a user can be granted in module 2, and the users assigned in module 2 are the people that can be placed on a workflow stage in module 3.
