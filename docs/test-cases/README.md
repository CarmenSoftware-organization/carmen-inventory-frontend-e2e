# Test-Case Catalogs

Stakeholder-friendly **test-case documentation** for the carmen-inventory-frontend-react app. These are **specification documents only** — they describe what each test case verifies (preconditions / steps / expected) but are **not yet automated Playwright specs**. They were authored by reading the actual React route modules, so every case is grounded in real UI fields, columns, filters, and flows.

Each file follows the TC-ID scheme in [`../test-id-scheme.md`](../test-id-scheme.md): `TC-<PREFIX>-<SS><NNNN>` (SS = section block, NNNN = sequence). Titles / preconditions / steps / expected are in Thai (matching the suite); Priority and Test Type are in English.

> **Relationship to `docs/user-stories/`:** that folder holds the **generated** stakeholder views of modules that already have automated specs (login, config master-data, vendor, PR/PO/GRN/CN/SR suites, etc.). This folder (`docs/test-cases/`) holds **hand-authored catalogs for modules that do not yet have a spec** — i.e. the coverage gap, including the entire Platform / System-Admin module. To graduate any catalog into an automated spec, register its prefix in `../test-id-scheme.md` first (the audit gate scans specs only, so these catalogs do not affect CI today).

**Totals:** 30 catalogs · 636 documented test cases.
