# Spec Health — what the suite actually tests

**Generated file — do not edit.** Run `bun audit:spec-health` to refresh.

Counting TC-IDs answers how many cases a spec *declares*. This counts how many
of them run, and how many of those assert anything. A case that is skipped, or
that runs without an `expect(...)`, reports green and checks nothing.

| | Count |
| --- | --- |
| Cases declared | 1418 |
| **Running** | **1174** |
| Skipped | 201 |
| Fixme | 43 |
| **Dormant** (skipped + fixme) | **17%** |
| Running cases asserting only through a page-object helper | 38 |
| **Running cases asserting nothing at all** | **285** |
| Running cases whose assertions are all trivial | 25 |
| Running cases behind an in-body skip guard | 239 |
| Assertions in running cases | 1522 |

**Trivial** means the assertion cannot fail — `expect(true).toBe(true)` and friends.
**Helper** counts calls like `pr.expectSavedToast()`: the page object asserts, so the case is fine —
it just does not say so in its own body. Only the last row is a case that checks nothing.

> **What this cannot see:** an assertion helper is recognised by its name (`expectSomething`).
> A page-object method that asserts under another name — `verifyX`, `assertY` — still reads as
> silent here. Open the case before acting on a number; the count is a place to look, not a verdict.

**Guard** counts running cases holding an in-body `test.skip(condition, ...)`. Dormant does not
include them: the case is declared as running and the reporter shows it, but whether it executes
is decided at runtime by a locator count or a seeded row. A guard that is always true is a case
that never runs and never says so — `304-pr-purchaser-journey.spec.ts` reads as 0% dormant while
four of its cases skip every run, because the page object looks for fields in a collapsed row that
only exist once the row is expanded. A high guard count is a place to look, not a verdict.

**Catch** counts `.catch(...)` calls in the file; they usually wrap an action, but one
wrapped around an assertion turns a failure into a pass, so a high count is worth a look.

## Per spec

Sorted by dormant share, then by cases that assert nothing.
