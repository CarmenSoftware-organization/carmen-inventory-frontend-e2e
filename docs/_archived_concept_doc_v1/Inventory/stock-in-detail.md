# GRN Movement Types and Logic Documentation

## 1. GRN Movement Classifications

### A. Movement Type Definitions
```
1. Inventory Movement (Stock)
   Type: MOVEMENT_INVENTORY
   Purpose: Items stored in inventory locations for later distribution
   Account Impact:
   - DR: Inventory (1140)
   - CR: Accounts Payable (2100)
   Location Type: Inventory Store

2. Direct Cost Movement (Direct)
   Type: MOVEMENT_DIRECT_COST
   Purpose: Items sent directly to consuming departments
   Account Impact:
   - DR: Department Expense (Various)
   - CR: Accounts Payable (2100)
   Location Type: Direct Cost Center
```

### B. Location Type Classifications
```typescript
enum LocationType {
  INVENTORY = 'INV',    // Inventory storage locations
  DIRECT = 'DIR'       // Direct cost centers
}

interface Location {
  code: string;
  name: string;
  type: LocationType;
  department: string;
  expenseAccount?: string;  // Required for DIRECT locations
  inventoryAccount?: string; // Required for INVENTORY locations
}

interface GRNItem {
  itemCode: string;
  description: string;
  quantity: number;
  unitCost: number;
  location: string;
  locationType: LocationType;
  movement: MovementType;
}
```

## 2. Mixed Movement Processing Logic

### A. Document Structure
```typescript
interface GRN {
  documentNo: string;
  date: string;
  supplier: string;
  status: string;
  items: GRNItem[];
  movements: Movement[];
  journalEntries: JournalEntry[];
}

interface Movement {
  type: MovementType;
  location: string;
  locationType: LocationType;
  items: {
    itemCode: string;
    quantity: number;
    unitCost: number;
    amount: number;
  }[];
}
```

### B. Processing Flow
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> DocumentCreated: Create GRN
    DocumentCreated --> ItemClassification: Classify Items
    ItemClassification --> InventoryMovement: Inventory Items
    ItemClassification --> DirectMovement: Direct Cost Items
    InventoryMovement --> UpdateStock: Update Inventory
    DirectMovement --> UpdateExpense: Update Department Expense
    UpdateStock --> GenerateJournals
    UpdateExpense --> GenerateJournals
    GenerateJournals --> DocumentCommitted
    DocumentCommitted --> [*]
```

## 3. Movement Classification Rules

### A. Item Level Rules
```
1. Location-Based Classification:
   IF location.type = INVENTORY:
      - Create inventory movement
      - Update stock balances
      - Generate inventory journal entries
   
   IF location.type = DIRECT:
      - Create direct cost movement
      - Update department expenses
      - Generate expense journal entries

2. Item Category Rules:
   - Fixed Assets → Always DIRECT
   - Consumables → Based on location
   - Stock Items → Based on location
   - Services → Always DIRECT
```

### B. Document Handling
```sql
-- Split movements by type
CREATE PROCEDURE ProcessGRNMovements
    @GRNNo VARCHAR(20)
AS
BEGIN
    -- Process Inventory Movements
    INSERT INTO Movements (
        Type, Location, ItemCode, Quantity,
        UnitCost, Amount, Reference
    )
    SELECT 
        'INVENTORY', i.Location, i.ItemCode,
        i.Quantity, i.UnitCost, 
        i.Quantity * i.UnitCost,
        @GRNNo
    FROM GRNItems i
    JOIN Locations l ON i.Location = l.Code
    WHERE l.Type = 'INV';

    -- Process Direct Movements
    INSERT INTO Movements (
        Type, Location, ItemCode, Quantity,
        UnitCost, Amount, Reference
    )
    SELECT 
        'DIRECT', i.Location, i.ItemCode,
        i.Quantity, i.UnitCost,
        i.Quantity * i.UnitCost,
        @GRNNo
    FROM GRNItems i
    JOIN Locations l ON i.Location = l.Code
    WHERE l.Type = 'DIR';
END
```

## 4. Journal Entry Generation

### A. Mixed Journal Structure
```sql
-- Generate multiple journal entries based on movement type
CREATE PROCEDURE GenerateGRNJournals
    @GRNNo VARCHAR(20)
AS
BEGIN
    -- Inventory Movements
    INSERT INTO JournalEntries (
        AccountCode, AccountName, Department,
        Debit, Credit, Reference
    )
    SELECT 
        l.InventoryAccount,
        'Inventory',
        l.Department,
        SUM(i.Quantity * i.UnitCost),
        0,
        @GRNNo
    FROM GRNItems i
    JOIN Locations l ON i.Location = l.Code
    WHERE l.Type = 'INV'
    GROUP BY l.InventoryAccount, l.Department;

    -- Direct Cost Movements
    INSERT INTO JournalEntries (
        AccountCode, AccountName, Department,
        Debit, Credit, Reference
    )
    SELECT 
        l.ExpenseAccount,
        'Department Expense',
        l.Department,
        SUM(i.Quantity * i.UnitCost),
        0,
        @GRNNo
    FROM GRNItems i
    JOIN Locations l ON i.Location = l.Code
    WHERE l.Type = 'DIR'
    GROUP BY l.ExpenseAccount, l.Department;

    -- Accounts Payable Entry (Combined)
    INSERT INTO JournalEntries (
        AccountCode, AccountName, Department,
        Debit, Credit, Reference
    )
    SELECT 
        '2100',
        'Accounts Payable',
        'FIN',
        0,
        SUM(Quantity * UnitCost),
        @GRNNo
    FROM GRNItems;
END
```

### B. Sample Journal Entries
```
Example GRN with Mixed Movements:

1. Inventory Items:
DR Inventory (1140)           5,000
   Department: Warehouse

2. Direct Cost Items:
DR Kitchen Expense (5110)     2,000
   Department: F&B
DR Room Supplies (5120)       3,000
   Department: Housekeeping

CR Accounts Payable (2100)    10,000
   Department: Finance
```

## 5. Movement Validation Rules

### A. Common Validations
```
1. Document Level:
   - Single supplier per GRN
   - Valid posting date
   - Authorized requestor
   - Budget availability

2. Item Level:
   - Valid item for location type
   - Valid cost center for direct items
   - Authorized quantity limits
   - Price variance thresholds
```

### B. Type-Specific Validations
```
1. Inventory Movements:
   - Storage location availability
   - Bin assignment required
   - Batch tracking if applicable
   - Quality check requirements

2. Direct Movements:
   - Department budget check
   - Authorization limits
   - Asset categorization
   - Cost center validation
```

## 6. Reporting Requirements

### A. Document Level Reports
```
1. GRN Summary:
   - Total by movement type
   - Location breakdown
   - Department totals
   - Account distribution

2. Audit Reports:
   - Mixed movement tracking
   - Cost allocation details
   - Authorization trail
   - Budget impact analysis
```

### B. Movement Analysis
```
1. Movement Type Distribution:
   - Ratio of direct vs inventory
   - Cost center analysis
   - Budget vs actual by type
   - Trend analysis

2. Location Analysis:
   - Movement patterns
   - Storage utilization
   - Direct delivery patterns
   - Cost center consumption
```

Would you like me to:
1. Add more validation rules?
2. Expand the journal entry scenarios?
3. Add more movement type classifications?
4. Include additional processing rules?
5. Detail the reporting requirements further?
6. Add system configuration options?
