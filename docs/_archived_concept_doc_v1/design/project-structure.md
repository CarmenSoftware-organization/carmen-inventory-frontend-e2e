## Key Components

### Navigation
- `components/Sidebar.tsx` - Main navigation component
  - Handles responsive behavior
  - Supports collapsible navigation
  - Implements multi-level menu structure

### UI Components
The application uses several UI frameworks and libraries:
- Shadcn UI
- Tailwind CSS
- Radix UI primitives
- Lucide Icons

## Routing Structure
The application uses Next.js 13+ App Router with the following structure:
- Route groups are organized under `app/(main)`
- Each major module has its own directory
- Complex features use nested routing
- Server and client components are properly segregated

## Best Practices
1. Server Components are preferred for better performance
2. Client Components are marked with "use client"
3. Responsive design is implemented throughout
4. TypeScript is used for type safety
5. Modular architecture for scalability
