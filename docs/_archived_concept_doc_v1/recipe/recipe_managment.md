**IV. Open Questions and Areas for Clarification:**

*   **Definition of "Total Mix":** The document mentions "Total Mix" and "Cost of Total Mix" but doesn't explicitly define what "Total Mix" represents. This needs clarification.
*   **Details of "Auto-running function":** The note "Note Add Auto running function" requires further specification on what functions run automatically and under what conditions.
*   **User Roles and Permissions:** The document doesn't explicitly mention user roles, but a recipe management system likely needs different access levels for viewing, creating, and editing recipes.
*   **Media Storage:** How will media attachments be stored (e.g., local file system, cloud storage)?
*   **Media File Size Limits:** Are there any limitations on the size of media files that can be uploaded?
*   **Wastage Calculation (Clarification):** Is the "Wastage (%)" applied to the quantity measured in the recipe's unit or the inventory unit?

This updated outline provides a more comprehensive view of the system's requirements, including the crucial additions of preparation steps and media attachment management. Addressing the open questions and further defining the non-functional requirements will be essential for successful development.
