---

## Technical Debt and Known Issues

### Development State

**Current Architecture**: Frontend-only implementation with comprehensive mock data

**Mock Data Architecture**:
- **Strengths**: Type-safe factories, comprehensive test scenarios, realistic business data
- **Production Requirement**: Replace with actual API endpoints and database integration

### Authentication System

**Current State**: Multiple authentication routes without backend integration
- `app/(auth)/login/[[...login]]/` - Catch-all login route
- `app/(auth)/signup/` - User registration (mock)
- `app/(auth)/signin/` - Alternative signin path

**Production Requirements**:
- Integrate with authentication provider (Auth0, Clerk, custom)
- Implement session management and JWT handling
- Add password reset and email verification workflows

### Data Persistence

**Current Limitation**: No database integration
- All data stored in memory during session
- Form submissions use React Hook Form with Zod validation
- No data persistence between sessions

**Integration Requirements**:
- Database schema implementation matching TypeScript types
- API endpoint implementation for all CRUD operations
- Migration from mock data to live data with seeding capabilities

4. **Accessibility Excellence**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all routes
5. **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive E2E and unit testing setup
6. **Developer Experience**: Excellent tooling, hot reloading, and debugging support

### Production Readiness Assessment

**Ready for Production**:
- ✅ Frontend architecture and user experience
- ✅ Component library and design system
- ✅ Type safety and data modeling
- ✅ Testing infrastructure and quality assurance
- ✅ Accessibility compliance and responsive design

**Requires Implementation**:
- 🔄 Backend API development and database integration
- 🔄 Authentication and authorization backend
- 🔄 File storage and document management
- 🔄 Real-time features and WebSocket integration
- 🔄 Production deployment and monitoring setup

### Technical Debt Summary

The primary technical debt is the absence of backend integration. The frontend architecture is production-ready and requires backend services to replace mock data with live data persistence. The comprehensive type system and factory patterns provide a clear blueprint for backend development.
