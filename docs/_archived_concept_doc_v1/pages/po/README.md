- **API Specifications**: Technical API endpoints and data models

## 📊 Key Features Summary

### Vendor+Currency Grouping Logic
One of the most important business features documented across all files:

1. **Automatic Grouping**: When creating POs from multiple PRs, the system automatically groups PRs by vendor and currency combination
2. **Separate PO Creation**: Each unique vendor+currency pair generates a distinct PO
3. **Item Consolidation**: All PR items within the same group are consolidated into a single PO
4. **Complete Traceability**: Full audit trail linking POs back to source PRs with detailed breakdown

### PR Source Traceability & Visibility
Comprehensive visibility into consolidated items:

1. **Source Tracking**: Each consolidated PO item maintains detailed records of all source PR items
2. **Visual Indicators**: Clear UI indicators show which items are consolidated from multiple PRs
3. **Breakdown Dialogs**: Detailed breakdown showing quantities, variances, and analysis from each source PR
4. **Variance Analysis**: Automatic calculation of quantity and price variances with reasons
5. **Cross-Department Tracking**: Visibility into cross-departmental consolidation
6. **Export Capabilities**: Detailed export of PR source breakdowns for audit and analysis

### Multi-Level Approval Workflow
Comprehensive approval system with:

- **Role-based approval limits**: Different spending authorities by role
- **Department-specific approvals**: Department heads approve their own department's requests
- **Financial oversight**: Finance team involvement for compliance and budget validation
- **Escalation procedures**: Automatic escalation for amounts exceeding user authority

### Comprehensive RBAC System
Security implementation including:

- **Role-based permissions**: 7 distinct roles with specific capabilities
- **Field-level security**: Granular control over data access and modification
- **Dynamic permissions**: Context-aware permission adjustment
- **Audit compliance**: Complete logging of all user actions

## 🚀 Implementation Guidelines

### For Developers
1. **Start with RBAC**: Implement security controls first using the RBAC documentation
2. **Follow Action Flows**: Use the action flow diagrams as implementation guides
3. **Validate Business Rules**: Ensure all business logic rules are properly implemented
4. **Test UI Specifications**: Verify all UI components meet the documented specifications

### For Business Analysts
1. **Review Business Logic**: Validate that documented rules meet business requirements
2. **Verify Action Flows**: Ensure workflows match actual business processes
3. **Check RBAC Rules**: Confirm role definitions align with organizational structure
4. **Validate Integration Points**: Review system integration requirements

### For QA Teams
1. **Test All Flows**: Verify each documented action flow works correctly
2. **Validate Permissions**: Test all RBAC scenarios and edge cases
3. **Check Business Rules**: Ensure all business logic validation works properly
4. **Verify UI Compliance**: Test UI specifications across all devices and browsers
