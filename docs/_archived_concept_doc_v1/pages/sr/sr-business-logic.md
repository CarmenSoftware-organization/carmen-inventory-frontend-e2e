## Document History

| Version | Date | Author | Changes |
|---------|------|--------|---------|
| 1.0.0 | 2025-11-19 | Documentation Team | Initial version |
This document outlines the business logic, rules, and constraints for the Store Requisition (SR) module.

## 1. SR Creation and Submission

### 1.1. Basic Creation Rules

*   A user can create a new SR, which will initially be in "Draft" status.
*   When a SR is created, it must have a requestor, a request date, and at least one item.
*   The user can save a SR as a draft at any time, and it will not enter the approval workflow.
*   To submit a SR for approval, the user must explicitly click the "Submit" button.
*   Upon submission, the SR status changes to "Submitted", and it enters the first stage of the approval workflow.

### 1.2. Required Field Validation

**Mandatory SR Header Fields:**
*   Reference Number (auto-generated in format SR-YYYY-NNN)
*   Request Date (cannot be in the past)
*   Movement Type (Issue, Transfer, Return)
*   Requestor Information (name, department)
*   Requesting From (source store/location)
*   Department (must match requestor's department)
*   Description (minimum 10 characters)

**Mandatory Item Fields:**
*   Item Code/Description
*   Request Quantity (must be positive number)
*   Request Unit (standard unit of measure)
*   Required Date (cannot be earlier than SR date)
*   Purpose/Justification

### 1.3. Business Validation Rules

*   **Duplicate Prevention**: System checks for duplicate SRs based on requestor, date, and similar item descriptions
*   **Quantity Constraints**: Request quantities must be positive numbers; zero or negative quantities not allowed
*   **Date Logic**: Required dates cannot be in the past; must be at least 1 business day from submission date
*   **Department Authorization**: Users can only create SRs for their assigned department unless granted special permissions
*   **Stock Availability Check**: System performs inventory availability check during creation (warnings for insufficient stock)
*   **Store Access Control**: Users can only request from stores they have access permissions for

## 2. SR Workflow and Status

### 2.1. Workflow Stage Progression

The SR workflow follows a series of stages, each requiring approval from a specific user role:

**Standard Workflow Sequence:**
1. **Requester** (Draft/Initial Creation)
2. **HOD Approval** (Head of Department Approval)
3. **Store Manager Approval** (Availability Check & Issue Authorization)
4. **Final Completion** (Items Issued/Complete)

### 2.1.1. Workflow Decision Engine

The system implements an intelligent **Workflow Decision Engine** that automatically determines the appropriate workflow action based on item status analysis:

**Priority-Based Decision Logic:**
1. **All Rejected**: If all items are rejected → Automatic SR rejection
2. **Any Review**: If any items need review → Return to previous stage
3. **Any Pending**: If any items are pending → Block submission (requires action)
4. **Any Approved**: If any items are approved → Allow progression to next stage

**Decision Engine Outputs:**
- **Action Type**: approve, reject, return, or blocked
- **Button Text**: Dynamic text based on workflow state ("Approve", "Return", "Reject")
- **Button Styling**: Visual indicators with appropriate colors (green for approve, red for reject, amber for return)
- **Validation Reason**: Clear explanation of why the action is or isn't available
- **Items Summary**: Count breakdown of approved, rejected, review, and pending items

**Workflow State Management:**
- **Real-time Analysis**: Engine evaluates workflow state on every item status change
- **Intelligent Blocking**: Prevents submission when items require attention
- **Clear Communication**: Provides specific feedback on what actions are needed
- **Status Aggregation**: Summarizes complex item states into actionable decisions

### 2.2. Workflow Actions by Stage

At each stage, the authorized approver can perform these actions:

#### **HOD (Head of Department) Stage:**
*   **Approve**: Moves SR to Store Manager approval stage for availability check
*   **Reject**: Returns SR to requester with rejection reason (status becomes "Rejected")
*   **Return**: Returns SR to requester for modifications (status becomes "Review")
*   **Request Information**: Adds comments requesting clarification without changing status

#### **Store Manager Stage:**
*   **Approve**: Authorizes item issue and moves SR to processing/completion
*   **Reject**: Returns SR to requester with availability/policy rejection reason
*   **Return**: Returns SR to previous stage or requester based on issue type
*   **Partial Issue**: Approves partial quantities based on availability
*   **Check Availability**: Reviews real-time inventory levels before authorization

#### **System Processing Stage:**
*   **Issue Items**: Updates inventory levels and creates movement transactions
*   **Generate Receipt**: Creates delivery receipt for issued items
*   **Complete**: Finalizes SR when all items have been issued or processed
*   **Handle Partial Fulfillment**: Manages scenarios where full quantities cannot be issued

### 2.3. Document Status Definitions

#### **Status Hierarchy and Constraints:**
*   **Draft**: Editable by requestor only; not visible to approvers; no workflow actions available
*   **Submitted**: Read-only for requestor; visible to HOD; workflow actions enabled
*   **In Process**: Active in approval workflow; editing restricted by stage and role
*   **Complete**: All items issued and workflow completed; SR closed and read-only
*   **Rejected**: Returned to requestor; editable for resubmission; comments required from rejector
*   **Void**: Cancelled SR; typically for duplicate or erroneous requests; read-only

### 2.4. Status Transition Rules

#### **Valid Transitions by Current Status:**
*   **Draft** → Submitted (by Requestor only)
*   **Submitted** → In Process, Rejected (by HOD)
*   **In Process** → Complete, Rejected (by Store Manager)
*   **Rejected** → Draft (by Requestor for resubmission)
*   **Complete** → Void (by System Administrator only, rare cases)
*   **Any Status** → Void (by System Administrator for cancellation)

#### **Transition Constraints:**
*   Status cannot skip stages (sequential approval required)
*   Rejected SRs must include mandatory rejection comments
*   Requestors cannot directly transition from "Submitted" back to "Draft"
*   "Complete" status is terminal (no further transitions allowed)
*   "Return" action creates special transition paths with audit trail
*   Store Managers can only transition to "Complete" after verifying inventory availability

## 3. Item Management

### 3.1. Basic Item Rules

*   Each SR must contain at least one item.
*   Each item has its own status (Pending, Approved, Rejected, Review).
*   The status of an item can be updated individually or in bulk.
*   When an item is added to a SR, it must have a product code, description, quantity, and unit of measure.
*   Item availability is checked against real-time inventory levels.
*   Items can be partially approved based on available stock levels.

### 3.2. Item Status Management

#### **Item Status Definitions:**
*   **Pending**: Newly added item awaiting first approval stage
*   **Approved**: Item approved by current workflow stage
*   **Rejected**: Item rejected with mandatory reason
*   **Review**: Item requires additional information or clarification
*   **Issued**: Item successfully issued from inventory (final status)
*   **Partial**: Item partially issued due to insufficient stock

#### **Quantity Management Rules:**
*   **Request Quantity**: Original quantity requested by user (cannot be zero)
*   **Approved Quantity**: Quantity approved by HOD (can be less than requested)
*   **Issue Quantity**: Final quantity issued by store manager (based on availability)
*   **Unit Conversion**: System handles conversion between request unit and standard inventory unit
*   **Partial Issue**: Issue quantity can be different from approved quantity due to stock constraints
*   **Over-issue**: Requires special authorization if issue quantity exceeds approved quantity (rare cases)

### 3.3. Inventory Integration Rules

#### **Stock Availability Checking:**
*   **On-hand Quantity**: Real-time inventory levels displayed for each item
*   **Available Stock**: On-hand minus committed quantities from other SRs

*   **Location-based Availability**: Stock levels shown per storage location
*   **Average Monthly Usage**: Historical consumption data for demand forecasting

#### **Inventory Impact Actions:**
*   **Soft Reservation**: When SR item approved by HOD, quantity soft-reserved from available stock
*   **Hard Commitment**: When approved by Store Manager, quantity becomes hard commitment
*   **Stock Issue**: When items issued, inventory levels updated immediately
*   **Allocation Rules**: Priority handling for critical departments vs. standard requests
*   **Movement Tracking**: Complete audit trail of all inventory movements

### 3.4. Cost Tracking and Valuation

#### **Internal Costing Methods:**
1. **Standard Cost**: Predetermined standard cost for internal transfers
2. **Moving Average**: Rolling average cost based on recent receipts
3. **FIFO Cost**: First-in-first-out cost calculation for issued items
4. **Last Cost**: Most recent cost from goods receipt

#### **Costing Business Rules:**

*   **Cost Tracking**: Full audit trail of cost basis for issued items
*   **Management Reporting**: Cost analysis by department, item category, and period
*   **Budget Impact**: Track against departmental budgets if cost allocation enabled

### 3.5. Item-Level Workflow Permissions

#### **Enhanced Item Action Framework:**
The system implements a sophisticated **Item Workflow State** engine that determines available actions based on:
- **User Role**: Organizational role (Staff, HOD, Store Manager, System Administrator)
- **Item Status**: Current item status (Pending, Review, Approved, Rejected)
- **Workflow Stage**: Current SR workflow stage (hodApproval, storeManagerApproval, processing)
- **Role Context**: Active role selection for multi-role users

#### **Smart Action Availability:**
- **Dynamic Permissions**: Available actions calculated in real-time based on role and context
- **Status-Based Logic**: Only relevant actions shown for current item status
- **Workflow Stage Validation**: Actions validated against current PR workflow stage
- **Comment Requirement**: Certain actions require mandatory comments for audit trail

#### **HOD (Head of Department) Actions:**
*   Can **Approve**, **Reject**, or **Return** any item with status `Pending` or `Review`
*   Can modify **Approved Quantity** (must be ≤ requested quantity unless justified)

*   Can **Delete** items from draft SRs
*   Cannot modify items once SR is submitted (except when returned for revision)
*   **Available Actions**: ['review', 'comment', 'history'] (for pending items only)

#### **System Administrator Actions:**
*   **Full Permissions**: Can perform all available actions regardless of workflow stage
*   **Override Capability**: Can approve, reject, or return any item at any stage

### 3.6. Split Items Action

#### **Split Conditions and Permissions:**
*   **Item Selection**: At least one item must be selected from the list within the SR Details page
*   **Authorization**: Can only be performed by original **Requestor** or **System Administrator**
*   **Status Requirement**: SR must be in modifiable status (`Draft`, `Rejected`, or `Review`)

*   **Approval Reset**: New SR must restart approval workflow from beginning
*   **Stock Allocation**: Original stock reservations may need rebalancing
*   **Location Grouping**: Items can be split based on different requesting locations
*   **Delivery Timing**: Items can be split based on different required dates
*   **Department Transfer**: Split can facilitate cross-department item allocation
*   **Urgency Separation**: Items can be split based on urgency levels (urgent vs. normal)

## 4. Cost Tracking and Department Allocation

### 4.1. Department Cost Control Framework

#### **Cost Allocation Rules:**
*   Each SR is associated with a **Requesting Department** based on requestor's department
*   **Cost Center** allocation optional for each SR (can span multiple cost centers)
*   **Project/Job Code** association for project-specific cost tracking
*   **Department Budget** impact tracking (optional based on organization policy)

#### **Cost Tracking Logic:**

*   **HOD**: Up to defined department limits (typically unlimited for normal items)
*   **Store Manager**: All items within stock availability
*   **General Manager**: Special items or controlled substances
*   **System Administrator**: Emergency overrides and system-level exceptions

#### **Item Control Categories:**
*   **Normal Items**: Standard approval workflow (HOD → Store Manager)
*   **Controlled Items**: Enhanced approval requirements and tracking
*   **High-Value Items**: Additional authorization levels based on item cost
*   **Restricted Items**: Special approval and justification required
*   **Emergency Items**: Expedited workflow with post-approval documentation

## 5. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The Store Requisition system implements a comprehensive dual-role RBAC system that supports users having multiple organizational roles and multiple workflow stage roles. This system provides precise control over permissions based on both the user's inherent organizational role and their assigned workflow stage role for each SR.

### 5.0. Multi-Role RBAC System Overview

#### **Dual-Role Architecture**
The system operates on two distinct but interconnected role types:

1. **Organizational Roles (User Roles)**: Permanent roles based on organizational structure
   - Staff/Requestor, Department Manager, Financial Manager, Purchasing Staff, System Administrator
   - Users can have multiple organizational roles simultaneously
   - Permission aggregation follows Union principle (user inherits permissions from all assigned roles)

2. **Workflow Stage Roles (Contextual Roles)**: Assigned per PR per workflow stage
   - Requestor, Approver, Purchaser, Observer
   - Users can be assigned multiple workflow stage roles across different PRs
   - Users can have different workflow stage roles for different stages of the same PR

#### **Permission Calculation Formula**
```
Final Permission = Active Organizational Role ∩ Max(Workflow Stage Roles) ∩ Current Stage ∩ Visibility Scope
```

#### **Visibility Rules Foundation**
- **Base Rule**: Users can ALWAYS see PRs they created (regardless of other permissions)
- **Extended Visibility**: Users can see department or BU PRs ONLY if explicitly assigned visibility permissions
- **Additive Model**: All visibility levels are cumulative (Own + Department + BU if assigned)

### 5.1. PR Visibility Matrix

#### **Base Visibility Rules**
| User Type | Own Created PRs | Department PRs | Entire BU PRs |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Any User** | ✅ Always Visible | 🔐 Only if Assigned | 🔐 Only if Assigned |
| **System Admin** | ✅ Always Visible | ✅ Always Visible | ✅ Always Visible |

#### **Assigned Visibility Permissions Matrix**
| Organizational Role | Default Visibility | Can Be Assigned Dept | Can Be Assigned BU |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Staff** | Self Only | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Department Manager** | Self Only | ✅ Yes (Own Dept) | 🔐 Special Approval |
| **Financial Manager** | Self Only | ✅ Yes (Any Dept) | ✅ Yes |
| **Purchasing Staff** | Self Only | ✅ Yes (Relevant Depts) | ✅ Yes |
| **System Administrator** | Full BU | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

#### **Visibility Assignment Authorization**
| Assigner Role | Can Assign Self | Can Assign Department | Can Assign BU |
|---------------|----------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **System Admin** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **BU Manager** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Department Manager** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Own Dept Only | ❌ No |
| **Financial Manager** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | 🔐 With Approval |
| **Others** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |

#### **Visibility Calculation Examples**
- **Example 1**: Staff user creates PR-001 → Can see PR-001 (own)
- **Example 2**: Staff user + Department visibility assigned → Can see PR-001 (own) + all department PRs
- **Example 3**: Department Manager + BU visibility assigned → Can see own PRs + all BU PRs
- **Example 4**: Multiple role user (Staff + Dept Manager) → Inherits highest visibility scope

### 5.2. Multiple Organizational Roles Support

#### **Role Combination Matrix**
| Primary Role | Secondary Roles Allowed | Permission Aggregation | Active Role Selection |
|-------------|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Staff** | Department Manager, Purchasing Staff | Union of Permissions | Required |
| **Department Manager** | Financial Manager, Purchasing Staff | Union of Permissions | Required |
| **Financial Manager** | Department Manager, Purchasing Staff | Union of Permissions | Required |
| **Purchasing Staff** | Department Manager | Union of Permissions | Required |
| **System Administrator** | All Roles | Full Permissions | Optional |

#### **Multi-Role Business Rules**
- **Rule 1**: Users can have multiple organizational roles simultaneously
- **Rule 2**: Permission aggregation follows Union principle (user inherits ALL permissions)
- **Rule 3**: Users must select "active" organizational role for current session
- **Rule 4**: Higher organizational role permissions override lower ones
- **Rule 5**: Active role selection affects current session permissions only

### 5.3. Workflow Stage Role Assignment Matrix

#### **Workflow Stage Roles per PR**
| PR Stage | Requestor | Approver | Purchaser | Observer |
|----------|-----------|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Draft** | ✅ Creator | ❌ None | ❌ None | 🔍 Assigned Users |
| **Department Approval** | 🔍 Creator | ✅ Dept Manager | ❌ None | 🔍 Others |
| **Financial Approval** | 🔍 Creator | ✅ Finance Manager | ❌ None | 🔍 Others |
| **Purchasing Processing** | 🔍 Creator | ❌ None | ✅ Purchasing Staff | 🔍 Others |
| **Completed** | 🔍 Creator | ❌ None | ❌ None | 🔍 All |

#### **Multiple Workflow Stage Roles Support**
| User Assignment | Same PR | Different PRs | Conflict Resolution |
|----------------|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Multiple Observer Roles** | ✅ Allowed | ✅ Allowed | No Conflict |
| **Requestor + Observer** | ✅ Allowed | ✅ Allowed | No Conflict |
| **Requestor + Approver** | ❌ Not Allowed | ✅ Allowed | System Prevents |
| **Approver + Observer** | ✅ Allowed | ✅ Allowed | User Chooses |
| **Approver + Purchaser** | ❌ Same PR | ✅ Allowed | System Prevents |

#### **Workflow Stage Role Assignment Rules**
- **Rule 1**: Each PR must have exactly one Requestor (the creator)
- **Rule 2**: Each workflow stage must have exactly one Approver assigned
- **Rule 3**: Each PR can have multiple Observers at any stage
- **Rule 4**: Users can hold different workflow stage roles for different PRs
- **Rule 5**: Workflow stage roles can be reassigned by administrators
- **Rule 6**: Users cannot be both Requestor and final Approver for same PR

### 5.4. Combined Permission Calculation Matrix

#### **Permission Aggregation Formula**
```
Final Permission = Active Org Role ∩ Max(Workflow Stage Roles) ∩ Current Stage ∩ Visibility Scope
```

#### **Role Combination Permission Matrix**
| Org Role | Workflow Role | Current Stage | Visibility Scope | Final Permission |
|----------|---------------|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| Staff | Requestor | Draft | Self | Full Edit (Own PR) |
| Staff | Requestor | Submitted | Self | View Only (Own PR) |
| Staff | Observer | Any | Department | View Only (Dept PRs) |
| Dept Manager | Approver | Dept Approval | Department | Approve (Dept PRs) |
| Dept Manager | Observer | Other Stages | Department | View Only (Dept PRs) |
| Financial Manager | Approver | Financial Approval | BU | Approve (All PRs) |
| Purchasing Staff | Purchaser | Purchasing | BU | Process (All PRs) |

#### **Multi-Role Permission Calculation Examples**

**Scenario 1: User with Staff + Department Manager roles**
- Available Roles: Staff, Department Manager
- Active Role: Department Manager
- Workflow Stage Role: Approver (Department Approval stage)
- Visibility Scope: Department
- **Result**: Can approve department PRs with full departmental financial access

**Scenario 2: User with multiple workflow stage roles**
- Organizational Role: Financial Manager
- Workflow Stage Roles: Observer (PR-1), Approver (PR-2)
- Visibility Scope: BU
- **Result**: Can view PR-1, can approve PR-2, sees all BU PRs

**Scenario 3: Conflict resolution**
- Organizational Role: Staff
- Workflow Stage Role: Requestor (created PR-1)
- System Assignment: Approver (PR-1) - BLOCKED
- **Result**: System prevents assignment, maintains segregation of duties

#### **Permission Hierarchy Rules**
- **Rule 1**: Organizational role provides base permission foundation
- **Rule 2**: Workflow stage role can enhance or restrict organizational permissions
- **Rule 3**: Current workflow stage validates action availability
- **Rule 4**: Visibility scope determines data access boundaries
- **Rule 5**: Most restrictive permission always takes precedence
- **Rule 6**: No permission can exceed user's organizational role limitations

### 5.5. Enhanced Field-Level Access Matrix

#### **Field Visibility by Role Combination**
| Field Category | Staff/Requestor | Staff/Observer | Dept Mgr/Approver | Finance Mgr/Approver | Purchasing/Purchaser |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Basic Info** | ✅ Edit | 🔍 View | 🔍 View | 🔍 View | 🔍 View |
| **Quantities** | ✅ Edit Request | 🔍 View | ✅ Edit Approved | ✅ Edit Approved | ✅ Edit Order |
| **Dates** | ✅ Edit Required | 🔍 View | 🔍 View | 🔍 View | ✅ Edit Delivery |
| **Vendor Info** | ❌ Hidden | ❌ Hidden | 🔍 View | 🔍 View | ✅ Edit |
| **Pricing** | ❌ Hidden* | ❌ Hidden* | 🔍 View | 🔍 View | ✅ Edit |
| **Financial** | ❌ Hidden | ❌ Hidden | ✅ Edit Discounts | ✅ Edit All | 🔍 View |
| **Budget** | ❌ Hidden | ❌ Hidden | 🔍 View Dept | ✅ Edit All | 🔍 View |
| **Comments** | ✅ Edit | ✅ Edit | ✅ Edit | ✅ Edit | ✅ Edit |

*Except with "Show Prices" toggle enabled

#### **Enhanced Field Permission Rules**
- **Financial fields are hidden from Staff organizational role** regardless of workflow stage role
- **Vendor information is hidden from Requestor workflow stage role** regardless of organizational role
- **Approval fields are only editable by Approver workflow stage role**
- **Procurement fields are only editable by Purchaser workflow stage role**
- **"Show Prices" toggle only affects total amounts**, not detailed pricing panels
- **Role-based panels are completely hidden** for unauthorized roles

#### **Multi-Role Field Access Logic**
1. **Base Access**: Determined by active organizational role
2. **Role Enhancement**: Workflow stage role can provide additional access
3. **Role Restriction**: Workflow stage role can restrict organizational access
4. **Stage Validation**: Current workflow stage validates field editability
5. **Scope Filtering**: Visibility scope determines which PRs are accessible
