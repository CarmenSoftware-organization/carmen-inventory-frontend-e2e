5. **Scalability**: Patterns that work from small to enterprise scale
6. **Maintainability**: Clear documentation and reusable patterns

### Module Coverage

This design system is extracted from the **Purchase Request module**, which represents the most sophisticated implementation in the Carmen ERP system:

**✅ Production-Ready Patterns:**
- Advanced RBAC with multi-role support
- Responsive list and detail page layouts
- Complex form management with field-level permissions
- Intelligent workflow decision engines
- Real-time updates and optimistic UI
- Comprehensive accessibility implementation

## 🏗️ Architecture Foundation

### Technical Stack

**Framework Foundation:**
```
Next.js 14 App Router + TypeScript
├── UI Components: Shadcn/ui + Radix UI primitives
├── Styling: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
├── Forms: React Hook Form + Zod validation
├── State: Zustand + React Query
├── Icons: Lucide React
└── Utilities: date-fns, clsx, cn
```

**Core Libraries:**
- `@radix-ui/react-*` - Accessible component primitives
- `lucide-react` - Consistent iconography system
- `tailwindcss` - Utility-first CSS framework
- `react-hook-form` - Performant form management
- `zod` - Runtime type validation
- `zustand` - Lightweight state management

### Design Principles

1. **Role-Based Progressive Disclosure**: UI adapts to user permissions
2. **Context-Aware Interfaces**: Components respond to workflow states
3. **Responsive-First Design**: Mobile-first with graceful enhancement
4. **Accessibility by Default**: WCAG compliance built into all patterns
5. **Performance-Optimized**: Lazy loading and virtual scrolling

## 📋 Component Patterns

### 1. List Page Pattern

**Standard layout for all module list pages:**
- Header with role-based actions and view controls
- RBAC widget filtering system with dynamic toggles
- Advanced filter panel with saved presets
- Table/Grid view toggle with responsive design
- Bulk operations with smart validation
- Pagination with summary statistics

**Key Components:**
- `ModuleHeader` - Standardized header with actions
- `RBACFilterBar` - Dynamic filtering based on user role
- `DataDisplay` - Responsive table/grid toggle
- `BulkActionBar` - Context-aware bulk operations

### 2. Detail Page Pattern

**Two-column responsive layout:**
- Main content area (70-100% width)
- Collapsible sidebar (30-0% width)
- Header card with mode switching (view/edit)
- RBAC field-level permissions
- Tabbed content with role-based visibility
- Floating action menu with workflow intelligence

**Key Components:**
- `DetailPageLayout` - Two-column responsive wrapper
- `DetailHeader` - Dynamic header with actions
- `RBACFieldRenderer` - Permission-aware form fields
- `TabbedContent` - Role-filtered tab system
- `FloatingActionMenu` - Context-aware workflow actions

### 3. Form Patterns

**RBAC-integrated form management:**
- Field-level permission checking
- Dynamic field rendering based on user role
- Intelligent validation with contextual rules
- Progressive disclosure of form sections
- Optimistic updates with error handling

### 4. Status and Badge System

**Consistent status representation:**
- Color-coded status badges with WCAG compliance
- Tooltip descriptions for accessibility
- Workflow stage indicators
- Progress visualization components

## 🔐 RBAC Integration Patterns

### Permission Layers

1. **Role-Based**: Core permissions tied to user roles
2. **Field-Level**: Individual form field access control
3. **Widget-Based**: Dynamic UI sections based on permissions
4. **Workflow-Stage**: Actions available based on process stage
5. **Context-Aware**: Permissions based on document state

### Implementation Patterns

**Service Layer:**
```typescript
interface RBACService {
  canPerformAction(user: User, entity: any, action: string): boolean;
  getAvailableActions(user: User, entity: any): string[];
  canEditField(fieldName: string, userRole: string): boolean;
  canViewField(fieldName: string, userRole: string): boolean;
  getRoleConfiguration(userRole: string): RoleConfiguration;
}
```

**Component Integration:**
- `withRBAC` Higher-Order Component
- `RBACWrapper` for conditional rendering
- `SmartActionButton` for context-aware actions
- `RBACSection` for progressive disclosure

## 📱 Responsive Design System

### Breakpoint Strategy

**Mobile-First Approach:**
- `< 768px`: Single column, simplified navigation
- `768px - 1199px`: Adaptive layout with collapsible elements
- `≥ 1200px`: Full desktop experience with all features

**Key Patterns:**
- Responsive grid systems with Tailwind utilities
- Progressive enhancement from mobile to desktop
- Touch-friendly interactions on mobile devices
- Adaptive navigation patterns

## ⚡ Performance Patterns

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Lazy Loading**: Components and routes loaded on demand
2. **Virtual Scrolling**: Large lists with react-window
3. **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback
4. **Caching**: Strategic use of React Query cache
5. **Code Splitting**: Module-level bundle optimization

### Implementation Examples

**Lazy Loading:**
```typescript
const HeavyComponent = lazy(() => import('./HeavyComponent'));
const SidebarContent = lazy(() => import('./SidebarContent'));
```

**Virtual Scrolling:**
```typescript
import { FixedSizeList as List } from 'react-window';
```

**Optimistic Updates:**
```typescript
const useOptimisticUpdate = <T>(updateFn: (data: T) => Promise<T>) => {
  // Immediate UI response with error fallback
};
```

## ♿ Accessibility Standards

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance

**Built-in Accessibility:**
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels and roles

- Accessible form validation and error messages
- Clear visual focus indicators

## 🧪 Testing Patterns

- Field visibility and editability validation
- Workflow action availability testing
- Widget access control verification

**Accessibility Testing:**
