This document outlines the product requirements, technical specifications, and functional design for the Purchase Request (PR) Split Items feature, enabling users to divide existing PRs into multiple independent requests for optimized workflow management.

## 1. Product Overview & Business Objectives

### 1.1. Feature Definition

The PR Split Items feature allows users to select specific items from an existing Purchase Request and create a new PR containing those items, while removing them from the original PR. This enables independent workflow progression for different groups of items based on urgency, vendor, department, or approval requirements.

### 1.2. Business Justification

**Primary Business Problems Solved:**
- **Mixed Priority Items**: Items with different urgency levels delay critical procurements
- **Vendor Dependencies**: Single PR with multiple vendors creates procurement bottlenecks  
- **Approval Efficiency**: Items requiring different approval paths block overall PR progression
- **Department Flexibility**: Cross-departmental PRs need independent processing
- **Workflow Optimization**: Enable parallel processing of related but separate procurement needs

### 1.3. Success Metrics & KPIs

**Key Performance Indicators:**
- 30% reduction in average PR approval cycle time
- 25% increase in urgent item processing speed
- 40% reduction in workflow bottlenecks
- 95% user satisfaction with split functionality
- 100% data integrity maintenance across split operations

**Usage Metrics:**
- Number of PRs split per month
- Split success rate (completed vs. failed operations)
- User adoption rate across different roles
- Time saved per split operation

## 2. Business Logic & Rules

### 2.1. Split Eligibility Rules

**PR-Level Requirements:**
- Original PR must be in "Draft", "Submitted", or early workflow stages
- PR must contain at least 2 items (minimum 1 item remains after split)
- User must have "Create PR" permissions for the relevant department
- Original PR cannot be in "Completed", "Cancelled", or "Rejected" status

**Item-Level Requirements:**
- Selected items must be in compatible workflow statuses
- Items cannot be partially received or in active purchase orders
- Items with dependencies (parent-child relationships) must be split together
- Financial commitments (approved budgets) must be transferable

### 2.2. Data Integrity Rules

**Original PR Changes:**
- Remove selected items from original PR
- Recalculate totals and budget allocations
- Update item counts and summary information
- Maintain audit trail of split operation
- Preserve remaining workflow state and approvals

**New PR Creation:**
- Inherit basic metadata from original PR (requestor, department, location)
- Generate new PR reference number
- Set initial workflow status based on item statuses
- Create audit trail linking to original PR
- Initialize new approval workflow if required

### 2.3. Financial Rules

**Budget Allocation:**
- Transfer budget allocations proportionally to new PR
- Update budget tracking for both PRs
- Maintain financial approval status where applicable
- Recalculate tax, discount, and total amounts
- Preserve currency and exchange rate information

### 2.4. Workflow Impact Rules

**Approval Status Preservation:**
- Approved items retain approval status in new PR
- Pending items maintain pending status
- Rejected items cannot be split (business rule)
- Review items can be split with review status

## 3. User Experience Specification

### 3.1. User Interface Requirements
