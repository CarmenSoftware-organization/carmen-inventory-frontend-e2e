This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for the Purchase Request Details interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

## Overall UX Goals & Principles

### Target User Personas

**Requestor/Staff:** Front-line employees who create purchase requests for operational needs. They prioritize ease of use, clear guidance, and quick task completion.

**Department Manager:** Mid-level managers who review and approve departmental purchase requests. They need efficient review capabilities and clear visibility into budget impact.

**Financial Manager:** Senior financial stakeholders who approve high-value purchases and monitor budget compliance. They require comprehensive financial information and audit trail visibility.

**Purchasing Staff:** Procurement specialists who coordinate vendor selection and purchase order creation. They need detailed item information and vendor comparison capabilities.

### Usability Goals

- **Ease of learning:** New users can complete core PR tasks within 10 minutes of training

- **Progressive disclosure:** Complex features are revealed as needed, keeping the interface clean

### Design Principles

1. **Role-based clarity** - Interface adapts to user permissions and responsibilities
2. **Workflow-driven navigation** - User journey follows natural business process flow
3. **Context-aware actions** - Available actions change based on document state and user role
4. **Immediate feedback** - Every action provides clear, immediate visual response
5. **Accessible by default** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with semantic markup and keyboard navigation

**Breadcrumb Strategy:** Back button with router navigation, maintaining list context and filters

## User Flows

### Purchase Request Review and Approval Flow

**User Goal:** Department Manager needs to review and approve/reject purchase requests efficiently

**Entry Points:** 
- PR List page (filtered by "Pending My Approval")
- Direct link from email notification
- Dashboard workflow widget

**Success Criteria:** 
- PR is approved/rejected with appropriate comments
- Next workflow stage is triggered automatically  
- Audit trail is preserved

#### Flow Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Access PR Details] --> B[Review Header Information]
    B --> C[Check Workflow Timeline]
    C --> D[Review Items in Items Tab]
    D --> E{All Items Acceptable?}
    E -->|No| F[Review Individual Items]
    F --> G[Make Approval Decisions per Item]
    G --> H{Mixed Approval Status?}
    H -->|Yes| I[System Shows Return Action]
    H -->|No| J[System Shows Approve/Reject]

    K --> M[Confirm Action]  
    L --> M
    M --> N[Action Processed]
    N --> O[Navigate Back or Next PR]
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- PR modified by another user during review - show conflict resolution dialog
- Network timeout during action submission - retry mechanism with progress indicator
- Insufficient permissions for action - clear error message with contact information
- Budget validation fails during approval - show budget impact and require override
- Required comments missing - highlight comment field with validation message

**Notes:** The workflow decision engine automatically determines available actions based on item approval status, reducing cognitive load on approvers.

### Purchase Request Creation Flow

**User Goal:** Staff member needs to create a new purchase request for operational supplies

**Entry Points:**

- **Floating Action Menu:** Scale and opacity transition (150ms) on state changes
- **Form Validation:** Shake animation (400ms) for error states with color transition
- **Status Badge Updates:** Gentle color transition (250ms) when status changes
- **Sidebar Toggle:** Slide animation (300ms) with opacity fade for content

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals

- **Page Load:** Sub-3 seconds on 3G networks
- **Interaction Response:** <100ms for immediate feedback, <200ms for complex operations  
- **Animation FPS:** Consistent 60fps for all motion design

### Design Strategies

Lazy loading for non-critical components, optimistic UI updates for user actions, efficient re-rendering with React.memo, image optimization with Next.js Image component, and progressive enhancement for advanced features.

## Next Steps
