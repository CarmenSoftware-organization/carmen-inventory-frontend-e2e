## 3. Business Rules

### BR-SYSADMIN-001: Policy Evaluation Order
**Rule**: Policies evaluated in descending priority order (highest priority first). If multiple policies match, combining algorithm determines final decision.

### BR-SYSADMIN-002: Role Hierarchy Inheritance
**Rule**: Child roles automatically inherit parent role permissions unless explicitly overridden. Maximum role hierarchy depth: 10 levels.

### BR-SYSADMIN-003: Single Primary Role
**Rule**: Each user must have exactly one primary role. Primary role determines default permissions and UI experience.

### BR-SYSADMIN-004: Approval Limit Enforcement
**Rule**: User approval limits must not exceed their role's maximum approval limit. Limits enforced in base currency (USD).

### BR-SYSADMIN-005: Subscription Limit Enforcement
**Rule**: System must prevent operations that would exceed subscription limits (users, locations, policies, etc.). Hard stop, not soft warning.

### BR-SYSADMIN-006: Audit Log Immutability
**Rule**: Audit logs cannot be modified or deleted. Records retained per compliance requirements (minimum 7 years for financial transactions).

### BR-SYSADMIN-007: Policy Status Transitions
**Rule**: Policy status transitions must follow: DRAFT → ACTIVE → INACTIVE → ARCHIVED. Cannot skip states. ACTIVE policies require approval.

### BR-SYSADMIN-008: Contextual Assignment Scope
**Rule**: Role assignments with scope restrictions (department, location, time) only grant access within defined boundaries.

### BR-SYSADMIN-009: Cache Invalidation
**Rule**: Permission cache must be invalidated when: (1) policy updated, (2) role assignment changed, (3) user attributes modified, (4) cache TTL expired.

### BR-SYSADMIN-010: Attribute Data Types
**Rule**: Attribute values must match declared data type. Type coercion not permitted. Invalid types reject evaluation.

### BR-SYSADMIN-011: Environment Attribute Refresh
**Rule**: Environment attributes (current_time, location, threat_level) must be refreshed on each access request evaluation.

### BR-SYSADMIN-012: Workflow Stage Assignment
**Rule**: Users can only be assigned to workflow stages within their authorized departments and locations.

### BR-SYSADMIN-013: SLA Calculation
**Rule**: Stage SLA countdown starts when stage becomes active. Business hours only (excludes weekends and holidays) unless configured otherwise.

### BR-SYSADMIN-014: Notification Delivery
**Rule**: Notifications sent to all configured channels (Email, System). Delivery failures retried 3 times with exponential backoff.

### BR-SYSADMIN-015: Location Hierarchy
**Rule**: Users assigned to parent location automatically have access to all child locations unless explicitly restricted.

### BR-SYSADMIN-016: Department Manager Authority
**Rule**: Department managers automatically have elevated approval authority for their department's transactions within configured limits.

### BR-SYSADMIN-017: System Role Protection
**Rule**: System-defined roles (admin, system_operator) cannot be deleted or have core permissions removed. Can only be deactivated.

### BR-SYSADMIN-018: Policy Conflict Resolution
**Rule**: When multiple policies apply with conflicting effects, combining algorithm determines result. DENY_OVERRIDES is default (DENY takes precedence over PERMIT).

### BR-SYSADMIN-019: Emergency Access Override
**Rule**: Emergency access requests bypass normal policy evaluation but are logged with high priority for immediate review.
