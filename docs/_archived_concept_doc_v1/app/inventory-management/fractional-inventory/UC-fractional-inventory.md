### UC-FI-006: Portion PREPARED Items

**Description**: User moves stock from PREPARED state to PORTIONED state, indicating items are ready for portion-level sales.

**Frequency**: Frequent (after preparation, typically 10-30 times per day)

**Preconditions**:
- User is authenticated
- User has "Inventory.FractionalInventory.Prepare" permission
- Stock exists in PREPARED state
- Stock quality is GOOD or EXCELLENT
- Stock is not within 30 minutes of expiry
- At least 1 hour of shelf life remains

**Postconditions**:
- Stock state updated from PREPARED to PORTIONED
- Portioned-at timestamp recorded
- Prepared-at and expiry-at timestamps preserved
- Quality grade maintained (not reset)
- Dashboard updated
- Activity log entry created

**Main Flow**:
1. User views fractional inventory dashboard
2. User identifies PREPARED stock ready for portioning
3. User clicks on stock row to view details
4. User clicks "Portion Items" button
5. System displays Portion Items dialog with:
   - Item name and current state (PREPARED)
   - Current whole units available
   - Current quality grade
   - Time to expiry
   - Prepared at timestamp
6. User enters portioning details:
   - Whole units to portion: 5 (number input, max = available PREPARED units)
   - Notes (optional): "Sliced and ready for service"
7. System validates portioning is appropriate:
   - Quality is GOOD or EXCELLENT ✅
   - Time to expiry > 1 hour ✅
   - Not within 30 minutes of expiry ✅
8. System displays portioning preview:
   - **Before**:
     - State: PREPARED
     - Whole units: 5
     - Prepared at: 10:00 AM
     - Expires at: 2:00 PM
     - Quality: EXCELLENT
   - **After**:
     - State: PORTIONED
     - Whole units: 5 (same)
     - Portions available: 40 (5 × 8 slices)
     - Portioned at: 10:30 AM
     - Expires at: 2:00 PM (preserved)
     - Quality: EXCELLENT (maintained)
9. User clicks "Confirm Portion" button
10. System validates portion operation:
    - Whole units available ≥ requested ✅
    - Stock state is PREPARED ✅
    - Quality is GOOD or EXCELLENT ✅
    - Time remaining > 1 hour ✅
11. System processes portion operation:
    - BEGIN TRANSACTION
    - UPDATE fractional_stock:
      - SET currentState = 'PORTIONED'
      - SET stateTransitionDate = NOW()
      - SET portionedAt = NOW()
      - SET totalPortionsAvailable = wholeUnitsAvailable × portionsPerWhole (5 × 8 = 40)
      - (preparedAt and expiresAt PRESERVED, NOT updated)
      - (qualityGrade MAINTAINED, NOT reset)
    - INSERT activity_log entry
    - COMMIT TRANSACTION
12. System displays success message: "Portioned 5 whole units. 40 portions now available for sale."
13. System closes dialog
14. System updates dashboard:
    - State badge updates to "PORTIONED"
    - Portions available displays 40 with visual progress bar
    - Quality badge maintains current grade
    - Expiry countdown continues from original prepared-at time
15. System triggers alert processing (UC-FI-102)

**Alternative Flows**:
- **Alt-6A: Portion All PREPARED Units**
  - User enters whole units = all available PREPARED
  - System updates existing stock record (no split)
  - State changes from PREPARED to PORTIONED in place
  - All whole units converted to portions

- **Alt-6B: Partial Portioning**
  - User enters whole units < all available PREPARED

    - Original stock: Remaining PREPARED units
    - New stock: PORTIONED units
  - Both stocks share same prepared-at and expiry-at

**Exception Flows**:

  - System validation fails: quality is FAIR, POOR, or EXPIRED
  - System displays error: "Cannot portion. Current quality: {grade}. Only GOOD or EXCELLENT quality can be portioned."
  - System suggests: "Perform quality check or mark as waste."
  - User cancels operation

- **Exc-6B: Too Close to Expiry**
  - System validation fails: time remaining < 1 hour
  - System displays error: "Cannot portion. Less than 1 hour until expiry. Item should be marked as waste or discounted for immediate sale."
  - User cancels operation

- **Exc-6C: Already Expired**
  - System validation fails: current time > expiresAt
  - System displays error: "Cannot portion. Item expired at {time}. Item must be marked as waste."
  - System auto-transitions to WASTE state after 1 hour grace period

**Business Rules Applied**: BR-FI-018, BR-FI-019
