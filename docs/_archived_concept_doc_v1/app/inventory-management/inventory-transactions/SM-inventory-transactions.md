# System Method: Inventory Transactions

## Document History

| Version | Date | Author | Changes |
|---------|------|--------|---------|
| 1.0.0 | 2025-11-19 | Documentation Team | Initial version |

## Purpose

The Inventory Transactions system manages all **physical inventory movements** across the organization, including receipts, issues, transfers, adjustments, and returns. It provides real-time inventory tracking and integrates with the centralized inventory valuation service for accurate costing.

**Important**: This document describes the **inventory transaction processing layer**. Some transaction types (GRN, Credit Note) are initiated and managed in other modules (Procurement), and this document focuses only on the inventory movement and costing aspects triggered by those external events.

**Document Scope**:
- ✅ Inventory transaction processing (IN/OUT movements)
- ✅ Integration touchpoints with other modules
- ✅ Inventory balance updates and costing
- ❌ GRN creation and management (see [Procurement: GRN](../procurement/BR-goods-received-note.md))
- ❌ Credit Note creation and management (see [Procurement: Credit Note](../procurement/credit-note/BR-credit-note.md))
- ❌ Purchase Order workflows (see Procurement module)

## Scope

### Transaction Types Supported

| Transaction Type | Direction | Costing Impact | Primary Module | Documentation |
|-----------------|-----------|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Goods Receipt (GRN)** | IN | Increases inventory value | Procurement | [GRN Documentation](../../procurement/BR-goods-received-note.md) |
| **Credit Note (CN)** | OUT | Decreases inventory value | Procurement | [Credit Note Documentation](../../procurement/credit-note/BR-credit-note.md) |
| **Store Requisition** | OUT | Decreases inventory value | Store Operations | (This module) |
| **Stock Transfer** | TRANSFER | Neutral (moves between locations) | Inventory Management | (This module) |
| **Stock Adjustment** | IN/OUT | Increases or decreases value | Inventory Management | (This module) |

**Note**: GRN and Credit Note are **Procurement sub-modules** with their own complete documentation. This document focuses on the **inventory transaction processing** triggered by these procurement events.

## Related Shared Methods

This module uses standardized **Inventory Operations** shared methods for common functionality:

### Application-Wide Usage

This system integrates with multiple modules:

| Module | Integration Point | Data Flow |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Procurement** | GRN posting, vendor returns | Receive goods → Create transaction → Update stock |
| **Store Operations** | Requisitions, wastage tracking | Issue goods → Create transaction → Reduce stock |
| **Production** | Material consumption, finished goods | Consume materials → Create transaction → Update WIP |
| **Inventory Management** | Stock counts, adjustments | Physical count → Create adjustment → Reconcile |
| **Finance** | Inventory valuation, COGS | Transaction → Get cost from valuation service → Post to GL |

### Integration with Inventory Valuation Service

**Key Principle**: Transaction processing is **separate from cost calculation**.

```
Transaction Processing          Inventory Valuation Service
(This System)                   (Shared Method)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Record physical movement ──→ 2. Calculate transaction cost
   (quantity, date, item)          (using FIFO or Periodic Average)
                            ←── 3. Return valuation result
4. Store transaction with cost
5. Update inventory balances
6. Trigger GL posting
```

**Benefits of Separation**:
- ✅ Single source of truth for costing logic
- ✅ Transaction processing doesn't need to know costing method
- ✅ Costing method can change without affecting transaction flows
- ✅ Consistent costs across all transaction types

## Business Rules

### 1. Transaction Processing

#### 1.1 Transaction Creation
- ✅ All inventory movements MUST create a transaction record
- ✅ Transaction date determines costing period (for periodic average)
- ✅ Each transaction has unique transaction number
- ✅ All transactions MUST reference source document (GRN, requisition, etc.)

#### 1.2 Transaction States

**Transactions WITHOUT Approval Workflow** (GRN, Vendor Return, Transfer, Adjustment):
```
DRAFT → POSTED → COMPLETED
  ↓        ↓
CANCELLED  REVERSED
```

**Transactions WITH Approval Workflow** (Store Requisition via workflow engine):
```
DRAFT → PENDING_APPROVAL → APPROVED → POSTED → COMPLETED
  ↓              ↓                        ↓
CANCELLED    REJECTED                 REVERSED
```

**State Rules**:
- ✅ Only POSTED transactions update inventory balances
- ✅ DRAFT transactions can be modified or cancelled
- ✅ PENDING_APPROVAL transactions can be approved, rejected, or cancelled
- ✅ POSTED transactions can only be REVERSED (not deleted or modified)
- ❌ COMPLETED and REVERSED transactions are immutable

**Approval Requirements by Transaction Type**:
- **GRN**: No approval (references already-approved purchase order)
- **Vendor Return (CN)**: No approval (returning defective/incorrect goods)
- **Stock Transfer**: No approval (movement between owned locations)
- **Stock Adjustment**: No approval (reconciling physical count)
- **Store Requisition**: Approval via configurable workflow engine

#### 1.3 Costing Integration
- ✅ Cost calculated at POSTING time (not creation time)
- ✅ Use transaction date to determine period for periodic average
- ✅ Store both unit cost and total cost on transaction
- ✅ Cost precision: 4 decimal places

#### 1.4 Inventory Balance Updates
- ✅ Balances updated atomically with transaction posting
- ✅ Support multiple locations per item
- ✅ Track quantity on-hand, allocated, available
- ✅ Prevent negative inventory (configurable per item)

### 2. Goods Receipt (GRN) - Inventory Transaction Integration

**Note**: For complete GRN process documentation, see [Procurement: Goods Received Note](../../procurement/BR-goods-received-note.md)

This section describes **only the inventory transaction processing** triggered when a GRN is committed.

#### 2.1 Inventory Transaction Creation (Triggered by GRN Commitment)
- ✅ GRN commitment creates inventory IN transaction
- ✅ Each GRN line item creates separate transaction (or combined based on configuration)
- ✅ Transaction cost comes from GRN (which comes from purchase order or invoice)
- ✅ Lot number and batch tracking inherited from GRN

#### 2.2 Inventory Processing When GRN Commits
```
GRN Committed (in Procurement module)
         ↓
Inventory Transaction Module receives event
         ↓
FOR EACH GRN line item:
  1. Create inventory transaction (IN movement)
  2. FOR FIFO: Create cost layer with GRN cost
  3. FOR Periodic Average: Invalidate period cost cache
  4. Update inventory balances (quantity on-hand)
  5. Queue GL posting (inventory debit, AP credit)
         ↓
Return success/failure to GRN module
```

#### 2.3 GRN Reversal Impact on Inventory
- ✅ GRN reversal (in Procurement) triggers inventory OUT transaction
- ✅ OUT transaction uses same cost as original GRN
- ✅ FIFO: Reverses the specific cost layer
- ✅ New GRN creates new IN transaction with updated cost

### 3. Store Requisition (Issues)

#### 3.1 Issue Processing
- ✅ Requisition creates inventory OUT transaction
- ✅ Cost determined by valuation service at posting time
- ✅ FIFO: Consumes oldest layers first
- ✅ Periodic Average: Uses period average cost

#### 3.2 Issue Posting Flow
```
1. Validate requisition data
2. Call valuation service to get cost
3. FOR FIFO: Consume cost layers (oldest first)
4. Create inventory transaction (OUT movement)
5. Update inventory balances (reduce quantity on-hand)
6. Post to general ledger (expense/COGS debit, inventory credit)
```

#### 3.3 Issue Types
| Issue Type | Cost Destination | Accounting Treatment |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Store Usage** | Cost of goods sold | Direct expense |
| **Production** | Work-in-progress | Inventory transfer |
| **Wastage** | Variance account | Loss/waste expense |
| **Sample** | Marketing expense | Operating expense |

### 4. Stock Transfer

#### 4.1 Transfer Processing
- ✅ Transfer creates TWO transactions: OUT from source, IN to destination
- ✅ Both transactions use same cost (no profit/loss on transfer)
- ✅ Transfer cost determined at transfer date
- ✅ Support inter-location and inter-department transfers

#### 4.2 Transfer Posting Flow
```
1. Validate transfer data (sufficient stock at source)
2. Call valuation service to get cost
3. Create OUT transaction at source location
4. Create IN transaction at destination location
5. Update inventory balances at both locations
6. Post to general ledger (location-specific accounts)
```

#### 4.3 Transfer Types
- **Direct Transfer**: Immediate movement between locations
- **In-Transit**: Stock in transit between locations (3-state: source OUT, in-transit, destination IN)

### 5. Stock Adjustment

#### 5.1 Adjustment Processing
- ✅ Adjustment reconciles physical count with system balance
- ✅ Creates IN transaction (if physical > system) or OUT transaction (if physical < system)
- ✅ Cost for IN adjustments: latest purchase price or standard cost
- ✅ Cost for OUT adjustments: determined by valuation service

#### 5.2 Adjustment Posting Flow
```
1. Perform physical stock count
2. Compare physical count vs. system balance
3. Calculate variance (physical - system)
4. IF variance > 0:
     Create IN transaction (call valuation service for cost)
   ELSE IF variance < 0:
     Create OUT transaction (use valuation service cost)
5. Update inventory balance to match physical count
6. Post to general ledger (variance account)
```

#### 5.3 Adjustment Reasons
- **Stock Count Variance**: Physical count doesn't match system
- **Damage**: Goods damaged and written off
- **Obsolescence**: Expired or obsolete stock
- **Initial Balance**: Opening balance setup
- **System Correction**: Correcting data entry errors

### 6. Credit Note (Vendor Return) - Inventory Transaction Integration

**Note**: For complete Credit Note process documentation, see [Procurement: Credit Note](../../procurement/credit-note/BR-credit-note.md)

This section describes **only the inventory transaction processing** triggered when a Credit Note (vendor return) is posted.

#### 6.1 Inventory Transaction Creation (Triggered by Credit Note Posting)
- ✅ Credit Note posting creates inventory OUT transaction
- ✅ Return cost references original GRN cost (for same lot/batch)
- ✅ Credit Note (financial document) created in Procurement module
- ✅ Inventory transaction reduces stock on-hand

#### 6.2 Inventory Processing When Credit Note Posts
```
Credit Note Posted (in Procurement module)
         ↓
Inventory Transaction Module receives event
         ↓
FOR EACH Credit Note line item:
  1. Get original GRN cost for returned items
  2. FOR FIFO: Reverse specific cost layer from original GRN
  3. FOR Periodic Average: Use period average cost at return date
  4. Create inventory transaction (OUT movement)
  5. Update inventory balances (reduce quantity on-hand)
  6. Queue GL posting (AP debit, inventory credit)
         ↓
Return success/failure to Credit Note module
```

## FIFO Cost Layer Management

### Layer Lifecycle (FIFO Method Only)

**Note**: Layer tracking is only used when company uses FIFO costing method. For periodic average, layer management is not required.

#### Layer Creation (GRN Posting)
```typescript
interface FIFOLayer {
  id: string
  itemId: string
  locationId: string
  lotNumber: string
  receiptDate: Date
  receiptNumber: string
  originalQuantity: number
  remainingQuantity: number
  unitCost: number
  totalCost: number
  createdAt: Date
}
```

**Rules**:
- ✅ Each GRN line creates a cost layer
- ✅ Layer tracks original and remaining quantity
- ✅ Layer includes lot number for traceability
- ✅ Cost stored at layer level (unit cost and total cost)

#### Layer Consumption (Issues, Transfers, Returns)
```
FIFO Consumption Algorithm:
1. Get all layers for item at location
2. Sort layers by receipt date ASC (oldest first)
3. FOR each layer:
     IF layer.remainingQuantity > 0:
       consumeQty = MIN(requiredQty, layer.remainingQuantity)
       totalCost += consumeQty × layer.unitCost
       layer.remainingQuantity -= consumeQty
       requiredQty -= consumeQty
     IF requiredQty == 0: break
4. IF requiredQty > 0: ERROR "Insufficient inventory"
```

#### Layer Reversal (GRN Edit/Delete)
- ✅ Reverse layer by creating negative transaction
- ✅ Restore layer's remaining quantity
- ❌ Cannot delete layer record (audit trail)

## Data Structures

### Core Transaction Record

```typescript
interface InventoryTransaction {
  // Identification
  id: string
  transactionNumber: string
  transactionDate: Date

  // Classification

}
```

## Integration Points

This section documents all external system integrations for inventory transactions, with specific focus on GRN (Goods Receipt Note) and CN (Credit Note/Vendor Return) workflows.

### 1. GRN Integration with Procurement Module

**Authoritative Documentation**: [Procurement: Goods Received Note](../../procurement/BR-goods-received-note.md)

**Module**: Procurement Management
**Transaction Type**: Goods Receipt (GRN)
**Movement Type**: IN
**Integration Type**: Event-Driven (GRN commits → Inventory transaction created)

#### Integration Flow
```
GRN Committed (Procurement) → Event Triggered → Inventory Transaction Created → Stock Updated
```

#### Key Integration Touchpoints

**1.1 Event Trigger from Procurement**
- **Event**: `grn.committed`
- **Payload Data**:
  - GRN ID and line item IDs
  - Item IDs and quantities received
  - Unit costs (from PO or invoice)
  - Receiving location
  - Lot/batch numbers (if tracked)
  - GRN commitment date
- **Inventory Module Response**: Success/Failure with transaction IDs created

**1.2 Inventory Transaction Processing**
- **Transaction Creation**: One inventory IN transaction per GRN line item (or consolidated)
- **Cost Assignment**: Uses cost from GRN (already validated in Procurement module)
- **FIFO Impact**: Creates cost layer with GRN cost (if FIFO method active)
- **Periodic Average Impact**: Invalidates period cost cache to force recalculation
- **Inventory Balance Update**: Increases `quantity_on_hand` at receiving location

**1.3 Response to Procurement Module**
```typescript
interface GRNInventoryResponse {
  success: boolean
  transactionIds: string[]  // Created inventory transaction IDs
  error?: {
    code: string
    message: string
    failedItems: Array<{itemId: string, reason: string}>
  }
}
```

**1.4 GRN Reversal Event**
- **Event**: `grn.reversed`
- **Inventory Action**: Creates OUT transaction with same cost as original
- **FIFO Impact**: Reverses (restores) the specific cost layer
- **Rollback**: If inventory reversal fails, GRN reversal should rollback in Procurement

**1.5 Error Handling**
- Insufficient location capacity → Reject with error
- Item not found in master data → Reject with error
- Cost calculation failure → Reject with error
- Inventory module returns detailed error for Procurement to display


### 2. Credit Note (CN) Integration with Vendor Returns

**Authoritative Documentation**: [Procurement: Credit Note](../../procurement/credit-note/BR-credit-note.md)

**Module**: Procurement Management
**Transaction Type**: Vendor Return (Credit Note)
**Movement Type**: OUT
**Integration Type**: Event-Driven (Credit Note posts → Inventory transaction created)

#### Integration Flow
```
Credit Note Posted (Procurement) → Event Triggered → Inventory Transaction Created → Stock Reduced
```

#### Key Integration Touchpoints

**2.1 Event Trigger from Procurement**
- **Event**: `credit_note.posted`
- **Payload Data**:
  - Credit Note ID and line item IDs
  - Original GRN references (for cost matching)
  - Item IDs and return quantities
  - Return location
  - Lot/batch numbers (must match original GRN)
  - Return date
- **Inventory Module Response**: Success/Failure with transaction IDs created

**2.2 Inventory Transaction Processing**
- **Transaction Creation**: One inventory OUT transaction per credit note line item
- **Cost Assignment**:
  - **FIFO Method**: Uses cost from specific layer of original GRN
  - **Periodic Average Method**: Uses period average cost at return date
- **FIFO Impact**: Restores (reverses) the specific cost layer from original GRN
- **Inventory Balance Update**: Decreases `quantity_on_hand` at return location

**2.3 Response to Procurement Module**
```typescript
interface CreditNoteInventoryResponse {
  success: boolean
  transactionIds: string[]  // Created inventory transaction IDs
  costDetails: Array<{
    lineItemId: string
    unitCost: number
    totalCost: number
    fifoLayerRestored?: string  // If FIFO method
  }>
  error?: {
    code: string
    message: string
    failedItems: Array<{itemId: string, reason: string}>
  }
}
```

**2.4 Error Handling**
- Insufficient quantity to return (more than GRN received) → Reject with error
- Original GRN not found or not posted → Reject with error
- FIFO layer not found or insufficient quantity → Reject with error
- Inventory module returns detailed error for Procurement to display

---

### 3. Integration with Inventory Valuation Service

**Service Location**: `/lib/services/db/inventory-valuation-service.ts`

**Purpose**: Centralized cost calculation for OUT transactions using configured costing method (FIFO or Periodic Average)

#### Usage Pattern
```typescript
import { InventoryValuationService } from '@/lib/services/db/inventory-valuation-service'

// When posting OUT transaction
const valuationService = new InventoryValuationService()
const costResult = await valuationService.calculateInventoryValuation(
  transaction.itemId,
  transaction.quantity,
  transaction.transactionDate
)

transaction.unitCost = costResult.unitCost
transaction.totalCost = costResult.totalValue
transaction.layersConsumed = costResult.layersConsumed  // FIFO only
```

#### When to Call Valuation Service
- ✅ Store requisition posting (OUT transaction)
- ✅ Stock adjustment posting (OUT variance)
- ✅ Vendor return posting (OUT transaction) - **Only for Periodic Average method**
- ✅ Transfer posting (determines cost for both OUT and IN)
- ❌ GRN posting (cost comes from purchase order/invoice, not valuation service)

**Referenced In**:
- [BR-TXN-011: Valuation Service Integration](./BR-inventory-transactions.md#fr-txn-011-integrate-with-inventory-valuation-service)
- [UC-TXN-101: Calculate Transaction Cost](./UC-inventory-transactions.md#uc-txn-101-calculate-transaction-cost-via-valuation-service)
- [FD: Valuation Service Integration Sequence](./FD-inventory-transactions.md#7-valuation-service-integration)

---

### 4. Integration with General Ledger

**Purpose**: Automatic financial posting for all inventory movements

#### GL Posting Pattern
```typescript
interface GLPosting {
  transactionId: string
  postingDate: Date

  entries: [
    {
      account: 'Inventory',
      debitCredit: 'DEBIT',
      amount: transaction.totalCost,
      costCenter: location.costCenter
    },
    {
      account: 'Accounts Payable' | 'COGS' | 'Variance',
      debitCredit: 'CREDIT',
      amount: transaction.totalCost,
      costCenter: location.costCenter
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Asynchronous Posting
- GL posting queued after inventory update (non-blocking)
- Batch processing every 5 minutes
- Retry logic for GL failures (max 5 retries)
- **Referenced In**:
  - [BR-TXN-007: Post to GL](./BR-inventory-transactions.md#fr-txn-007-post-transactions-to-inventory-and-gl)
  - [FD: GL Posting Integration Flow](./FD-inventory-transactions.md#8-general-ledger-gl-posting-integration)

---

### 5. Integration with Period-End Processing

**Purpose**: Month-end inventory valuation and reconciliation

#### Month-End Workflow
```
1. Period Close Initiated
2. FOR Periodic Average Method:
     - Finalize all pending transactions
     - Calculate final period average cost
     - Cache period cost for month
     - Lock period (no new backdated transactions)
3. Run inventory valuation report
4. Reconcile inventory to general ledger
5. Close period
```

**Referenced In**:
- [BR-TXN-013: Period Cost Cache](./BR-inventory-transactions.md#br-txn-013-period-cost-cache-invalidation)
- Related: [Inventory Valuation Period Processing](../../shared-methods/inventory-valuation/SM-inventory-valuation.md)

## Performance Considerations

### Transaction Volume
- **Expected**: 10,000+ transactions per month
- **Peak**: Month-end processing (5x normal volume)
- **Response Time Target**: <500ms for single transaction posting

### Optimization Strategies

#### 1. Batch Processing
```typescript
// Instead of individual posts
for (const item of items) {
  await postTransaction(item)  // ❌ Slow
}

// Use batch API
await postTransactionBatch(items)  // ✅ Fast
```

#### 2. Asynchronous GL Posting
```
Transaction Posted → Queue GL Posting → Background Job Posts to GL
    (immediate)         (async, <1s)        (batch every 5 mins)
```

#### 3. Layer Query Optimization (FIFO)
```sql
-- Indexed query for layer retrieval
CREATE INDEX idx_fifo_layers_item_date
  ON fifo_cost_layers (item_id, location_id, receipt_date, remaining_quantity);

-- Query only active layers
SELECT * FROM fifo_cost_layers
WHERE item_id = ?
  AND location_id = ?
  AND remaining_quantity > 0
ORDER BY receipt_date ASC, lot_number ASC;
```

#### 4. Balance Update Locking
```typescript
// Optimistic locking for inventory balance
await db.query(`
  UPDATE inventory_status
  SET quantity_on_hand = quantity_on_hand + ?,
      updated_at = NOW(),
      version = version + 1
  WHERE item_id = ?
    AND location_id = ?
    AND version = ?
`, [quantity, itemId, locationId, currentVersion])

if (affectedRows === 0) {
  throw new ConcurrencyError('Inventory balance was modified by another transaction')
}
```

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

| Error Code | Cause | Resolution |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| `TXN-001` | Insufficient inventory for OUT transaction | Increase quantity or cancel transaction |
| `TXN-002` | Invalid transaction date (future date) | Correct transaction date |
| `TXN-003` | Item not found | Verify item ID, check master data |
| `TXN-004` | Location not found | Verify location ID, check master data |
| `TXN-005` | Source document not found | Verify GRN/requisition exists and is posted |
| `TXN-006` | Costing service error | Check valuation service logs, verify period costs |
| `TXN-007` | Concurrency conflict | Retry transaction |
| `TXN-008` | Negative inventory not allowed | Enable backorder or adjust stock |

### Error Response Structure

```typescript
interface TransactionError {
  code: string
  message: string
  transactionId?: string
  itemId?: string
  locationId?: string
  details?: {
    availableQuantity?: number
    requiredQuantity?: number
    transactionDate?: Date
  }
}
```

## Security & Permissions

### Role-Based Access

| Role | Create | Approve | Post | Reverse | Delete |
|------|--------|---------|------|---------|--------|
| **Store Staff** | Requisitions | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Draft only |
| **Store Manager** | All | Requisitions | Requisitions | ❌ | Posted (with approval) |
