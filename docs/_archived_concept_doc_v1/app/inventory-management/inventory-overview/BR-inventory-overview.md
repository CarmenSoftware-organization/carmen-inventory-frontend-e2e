## Business Rules

### BR-INV-OVW-001: Location-Based Access Control
**Rule**: Users can only view inventory data for locations they are assigned to, unless they have System Administrator role.

**Rationale**: Protect sensitive inventory data and enforce organizational boundaries.

**Implementation**:
- Filter location list by user's `availableLocations` array
- Aggregate metrics only include accessible locations
- Bypass filtering for System Administrator role

**Source Evidence**: `app/(main)/inventory-management/stock-overview/page.tsx:76-91`

---

### BR-INV-OVW-002: Stock Level Alert Thresholds
**Rule**:
- **Low Stock**: Item quantity ≤ reorder point
- **Expiring Soon**: Item expiry date ≤ current date + 7 days

**Rationale**: Provide advance warning for procurement and waste prevention.

**Implementation**:
- Low stock calculation: `quantityOnHand <= reorderPoint`
- Expiring calculation: `expiryDate <= today + 7 days`

---

### BR-INV-OVW-003: Performance Classification Algorithm
**Rule**: Location performance classified based on weighted metrics:
- **Excellent**: Stock efficiency ≥ 90% AND turnover ≥ 8 AND fill rate ≥ 95%
- **Good**: Stock efficiency ≥ 80% AND turnover ≥ 6 AND fill rate ≥ 90%
- **Average**: Stock efficiency ≥ 70% AND turnover ≥ 4 AND fill rate ≥ 85%
- **Poor**: Below average thresholds

**Rationale**: Standardize performance assessment across locations.

**Source Evidence**: `lib/mock-data/location-inventory.ts:154-168`

---

### BR-INV-OVW-004: Transfer Priority Calculation
**Rule**: Transfer suggestions prioritized by:
1. **High Priority**: Stockout risk (qty < 10% of reorder point) OR expiry within 3 days
2. **Medium Priority**: Approaching reorder point OR expiry within 7 days
3. **Low Priority**: Optimization opportunity (excess at one location, normal at another)

**Rationale**: Prioritize actions that prevent stockouts and reduce waste.

**Source Evidence**: `lib/mock-data/location-inventory.ts:308-335`

---

### BR-INV-OVW-005: Currency Display
**Rule**: All monetary values displayed in hotel's base currency with proper formatting (comma separators, 2 decimal places).

**Implementation**: Use `formatCurrency()` utility function.

**Source Evidence**: `lib/utils/formatters.ts`

---

### BR-INV-OVW-006: Chart Data Aggregation
**Rule**: When "All Locations" selected, aggregate data by:
- **Quantities**: Simple summation across locations
- **Values**: Sum of (quantity × unit cost) across locations
- **Averages**: Weighted average based on quantities

**Rationale**: Provide accurate multi-location analytics.

**Source Evidence**: `app/(main)/inventory-management/stock-overview/page.tsx:98-114`
