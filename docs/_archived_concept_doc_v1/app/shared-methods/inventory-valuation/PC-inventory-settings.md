## Page Description/Instructions

**Instructional Text**:
```
Configure how inventory costs are calculated throughout the system. The costing method you select will apply to all inventory items across all locations. Changing this setting will affect all future inventory transactions but will not recalculate historical data.
```

**Help Text/Tooltip**:
```
ℹ️ The costing method determines how inventory values are calculated for:
• Credit notes and returns
• Stock adjustments
• Inventory reports and analytics
• Cost of goods sold calculations

Choose carefully - changing this setting impacts financial reporting.
```

## Form Sections

### Section 1: Current Configuration

#### Section Header
**Title**: Costing Method
**Description**: Select the inventory costing method to use system-wide
**Help Icon**: ℹ️ Hover text: "This setting applies to all inventory items and locations. Historical transactions remain unchanged."

#### Form Fields

| Field Label | Type | Placeholder | Help Text | Required | Validation |
|-------------|------|-------------|-----------|----------|------------|
| Costing Method | Radio Group | N/A | Select one method | Yes | Must select FIFO or AVG (Periodic Average) |
| Period Type | Read-only Text | N/A | Calendar Month (fixed) | N/A | N/A |
| Last Updated | Read-only DateTime | N/A | Shows when setting was last changed | N/A | N/A |
| Last Updated By | Read-only Text | N/A | Shows who made the last change | N/A | N/A |

#### Radio Group Options: Costing Method

**Option 1: FIFO (First-In-First-Out)**
```
Radio Button: ○ FIFO (First-In-First-Out)

Description below radio:
Inventory costs are calculated by consuming the oldest stock first. Each receipt creates a separate cost layer, and costs are taken from the oldest layers when inventory is consumed.

Best for:
• Products with expiration dates
• Perishable goods
• When physical flow matches FIFO assumption
• Regulatory compliance requiring FIFO

Impact:
• More accurate cost tracking per batch/lot
• Requires tracking individual receipt layers
• May show higher profits in periods of rising costs
```

**Option 2: AVG (Periodic Average)**
```
Radio Button: ○ Periodic Average (Database value: AVG)

Description below radio:
Inventory costs are calculated using the average cost for the calendar month. All receipts in a month are averaged together, and that average cost is used for all transactions in that period.

Best for:
• High-volume, low-value items
• When individual batch tracking is not required
• Simplified accounting processes
• Stable pricing environments

Impact:
• Simplified cost calculations
• Better performance for high transaction volumes
• Costs are smoothed within each month
• Recalculates monthly based on all receipts
```

#### Field-Level Messages
| Field | Message Type | Message Text |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| Costing Method | Warning | ⚠️ Changing the costing method will affect all future inventory valuations. Historical transactions will retain their original costs. This change cannot be undone automatically. |
| Period Type | Info | ℹ️ Period type is fixed to Calendar Month and cannot be changed. All Periodic Average calculations use the 1st to last day of each calendar month. |

## Brand Voice Guidelines

### Tone
- Professional and authoritative (dealing with financial settings)
- Clear and direct (avoiding ambiguity in important decisions)
- Supportive and informative (helping users make correct choices)
- Warning without being alarmist (appropriate for financial impact)

### Writing Style
- Active voice preferred: "You are about to change..." vs "The costing method will be changed..."
- Second person: Directly address the user ("You", "Your")
- Present tense for current states, future tense for impacts
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Use bullet points for non-sequential information

### Terminology Standards
| Preferred Term | Avoid | Context |
|----------------|-------|---------|
| Costing Method | Cost Method, Pricing Method, Valuation Method | System setting name |
| FIFO (First-In-First-Out) | FIFO Costing, First In First Out | Costing method name |
| Periodic Average | Monthly Average, Average Cost, Avg Cost | Costing method name |
| Calendar Month | Month, Monthly Period | Period type |
| Audit History | Change Log, History, Audit Trail | Historical changes |
| Change Justification | Reason, Explanation | Business reason field |
| Approved By | Authorized By, Approver | Authorization field |
| Settings | Configuration, Setup, Preferences | System settings |
| Save Changes | Apply, Update, Submit | Save action |
| Company-wide | System-wide, Organization-wide, Enterprise-wide | Scope of setting |

## Document Revision Notes

**✅ Schema Alignment Completed** (2025-11-03)

This document has been updated to accurately reflect the **actual Prisma database schema** defined in `/app/data-struc/schema.prisma`.

**Key Updates**:
- Costing method enum values clarified: Database uses `FIFO` and `AVG` (display as "Periodic Average")
- Added schema references throughout document with line number citations
- Updated audit trail references to use `tb_activity` table (schema.prisma:721-732)
- Enum reference: `enum_calculation_method` (schema.prisma:42-45)
- All data structures and references now align with actual Prisma models
