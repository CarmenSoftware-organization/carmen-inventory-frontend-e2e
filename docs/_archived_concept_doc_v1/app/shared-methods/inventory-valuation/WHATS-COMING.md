**What It Does**:
Clear categorization of transaction types eliminates ambiguity in queries and reports.

**Before** (Inferred Types):
```sql
-- Must infer from qty fields
WHERE in_qty > 0  -- Assume receipt (LOT)
WHERE out_qty > 0  -- Assume consumption (ADJUSTMENT)
```

**After** (Explicit Types):
```sql
-- Crystal clear intent
WHERE transaction_type = 'LOT'        -- Receipt
WHERE transaction_type = 'ADJUSTMENT' -- Consumption
WHERE transaction_type = 'TRANSFER'   -- Location move
```

**Transaction Types**:
- `LOT`: Initial receipt creating new lot
- `ADJUSTMENT`: Consumption reducing lot quantity
