## ⚠️ Current Limitations & Workarounds

### Understanding Limitations
These are not bugs—they are features planned for future phases. The system works correctly within its current design.

### Top 5 Limitations Users Should Know

#### 1. **No Automatic Lot Number Generation**
- **Current**: Manual entry of lot numbers following format guidelines
- **Impact**: Risk of inconsistent formats or duplicates
- **Workaround**: Use location-specific naming conventions
- **Enhancement**: Phase 2 (1 week) - Auto-generation with sequence management

#### 2. **Limited Transaction Categorization**
- **Current**: Cannot programmatically distinguish lot creation from consumption
- **Impact**: Queries must use `in_qty`/`out_qty` patterns to infer type
- **Workaround**: Use `from_lot_no` field in transaction_detail
- **Enhancement**: Phase 1 (1-2 weeks) - Add `transaction_type` field

#### 3. **No Parent Lot Traceability**
- **Current**: Cannot directly link consumption to source lot
- **Impact**: Audit trail requires joining multiple tables
- **Workaround**: Use `from_lot_no` reference in transaction_detail
- **Enhancement**: Phase 1 (1-2 weeks) - Add `parent_lot_no` field

#### 4. **No Period Locking**
- **Current**: Cannot prevent changes to closed periods
- **Impact**: Late receipts can change historical costs
- **Workaround**: Manual freeze process at month-end
- **Enhancement**: Phase 4 (2-3 weeks) - Period lifecycle management

#### 5. **No Automated Snapshots**
- **Current**: No automatic period-end balance preservation
- **Impact**: Historical reports recalculated each time
- **Workaround**: Export month-end reports manually
- **Enhancement**: Phase 4 (2-3 weeks) - Automated snapshot creation

## 📦 Phase 1: Schema Enhancement (1-2 weeks)

### Overview
Foundation enhancements to enable advanced features. Adds missing fields and tables required for full lot-based costing.

### What's Being Added

#### 1.1 New Fields in `tb_inventory_transaction_closing_balance`

| Field | Type | Purpose | Example |
|-------|------|---------|---------|
| `transaction_type` | ENUM | 8 explicit transaction types | 'RECEIVE', 'ISSUE', 'ADJ_IN', 'ADJ_OUT', 'TRANSFER_IN', 'TRANSFER_OUT', 'OPEN', 'CLOSE' |
| `parent_lot_no` | VARCHAR(50) | Link adjustments to source lot (NULL for LOT layer, NOT NULL for ADJUSTMENT layer) | 'MK-250115-0001' |
| `transaction_reason` | VARCHAR(20) | Categorize adjustments | 'PRODUCTION', 'WASTAGE' |

**Transaction Type Details**:
- **LOT Layer** (parent_lot_no IS NULL): RECEIVE, TRANSFER_IN, OPEN, CLOSE - Creates new independent lots
- **ADJUSTMENT Layer** (parent_lot_no IS NOT NULL): ISSUE, ADJ_IN, ADJ_OUT, TRANSFER_OUT - References and reduces parent lots
- **Layer Logic**: Automatically determined by parent_lot_no presence/absence

**Business Value**: Full traceability from consumption back to source lot, crystal-clear transaction categorization, automated audit reports with layer identification

#### 1.2 New Period Management Tables

**`tb_period`** - Period Lifecycle Management
```sql
CREATE TABLE tb_period (
  period_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,  -- Format: YY-MM (e.g., '25-01')
  status ENUM('OPEN', 'CLOSED', 'LOCKED'),
  start_date DATE,
  end_date DATE,
  closed_at TIMESTAMP,
  closed_by VARCHAR(50)
)
```

**`tb_period_snapshot`** - Historical Balance Preservation
```sql
CREATE TABLE tb_period_snapshot (
  snapshot_id VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
  period_id VARCHAR(10),
  item_id VARCHAR(50),
  location_id VARCHAR(50),
  opening_balance DECIMAL(20,5),
  closing_balance DECIMAL(20,5),
  status ENUM('DRAFT', 'FINALIZED', 'LOCKED')
)
```

**Business Value**: Prevent backdated changes, preserve historical costs, automated month-end close

### Overview
Implement full parent-child lot traceability and handle all edge cases.

### What's Being Added

#### 3.1 Parent Lot Linkage
Every consumption transaction will populate `parent_lot_no`:
```typescript
{
  lot_no: "MK-250115-0001",
  transaction_type: "ADJUSTMENT",
  parent_lot_no: "MK-250110-0001",  // ⭐ NEW: Links to source lot
  out_qty: 25.00000,
  cost_per_unit: 12.50000
}
```

#### 3.2 Enhanced FIFO Queries
```sql
-- New: Trace consumption back to source
SELECT
  consumption.lot_no as consumption_lot,
  consumption.parent_lot_no as source_lot,
  consumption.out_qty,
  source.in_qty as original_receipt
FROM tb_inventory_transaction_closing_balance consumption
INNER JOIN tb_inventory_transaction_closing_balance source
  ON consumption.parent_lot_no = source.lot_no
WHERE consumption.transaction_type = 'ADJUSTMENT'
```

#### 3.3 Edge Case Handling

## 📊 Phase 4: Period Management & Automated Revaluation (2-3 weeks)

### Overview
Complete period lifecycle management with locking, automated snapshots, and **Enhanced Periodic Average revaluation automation**.

### What's Being Added

#### 4.1 Automated Period-End Revaluation (Enhanced Periodic Average)

**Enhanced Periodic Average with Automated Revaluation**:
```
During Period:
- Receipts recorded at actual cost (RECEIVE transactions)
- Consumption uses cached period average for reference
- Inventory maintained at actual cost throughout period

Period-End Close (Automated Revaluation):
1. ✅ Calculate final period average from all receipts
2. ✅ Generate CLOSE transaction for ending inventory
3. ✅ Revalue remaining inventory to period average cost
4. ✅ Calculate Diff variance = (Avg × Qty) - Book Value
5. ✅ Post Diff to revaluation variance account (P&L)
6. ✅ Create OPEN transaction for next period opening balance
7. ✅ Standardize opening balance at period average cost
   Duration: <5 minutes (automated)
```

**Revaluation Transaction Types**:
- **CLOSE**: Revalues ending inventory to period average (LOT layer, no parent)
- **OPEN**: Creates opening balance at period average (LOT layer, no parent)
- **Diff Column**: Tracks revaluation variance + rounding errors

**Business Value**:
- ✅ Consistent inventory costs period-to-period
- ✅ Automatic variance tracking and P&L posting
- ✅ Clean opening balance at period average
- ✅ Simplified reconciliation and reporting
- ✅ Accurate period-to-period cost comparisons
- ✅ Automated revaluation journal entries

#### 4.2 Period Status Lifecycle
```
OPEN → (Month-End Close) → CLOSED → (Lock) → LOCKED
  ↓                                              ↑
  └─────────── (Re-open if needed) ─────────────┘
```

**State Rules**:
- **OPEN**: Normal operations, transactions allowed
- **CLOSED**: Period closed, no new transactions (unless re-opened)
- **LOCKED**: Permanently locked, no changes allowed

#### 4.3 Automated Snapshot Creation
System automatically creates period-end snapshots showing:
- Opening balance (from previous period OPEN transaction)
- Receipts during period (RECEIVE, TRANSFER_IN)
- Issues during period (ISSUE, ADJ_OUT, TRANSFER_OUT)
- Transfers during period (TRANSFER_IN, TRANSFER_OUT)
- Adjustments during period (ADJ_IN, ADJ_OUT)
- **Revaluation variance** (CLOSE transaction Diff column)
- Closing balance (from CLOSE transaction to next period OPEN)

#### 4.4 Period Close Process with Revaluation
```typescript
async function closePeriod(periodId: string) {
  // 1. Validate all transactions posted
  // 2. Create snapshots for all item-location combinations
  // 3. Calculate period average costs from RECEIVE transactions
  // 4. Generate CLOSE transactions (revalue to period average)
  //    - Calculate Diff variance = (Period Avg × Qty) - Book Value
  //    - Post Diff to revaluation variance account (P&L)
  // 5. Update period status to CLOSED
  // 6. Create OPEN transactions for next period
  //    - Opening balance at period average cost
  //    - Clean slate for next period calculations
}
```
