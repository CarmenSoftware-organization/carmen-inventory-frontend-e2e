## Description
The Carmen ERP Dashboard and Analytics system provides a comprehensive overview of the organization's procurement, inventory, and operational performance through an interactive dashboard interface. The system displays real-time key performance indicators (KPIs), trend analysis charts, and recent activity monitoring. It features responsive card-based layouts with metric cards showing current values and percentage changes, interactive charts for trend visualization, and a comprehensive activity table that tracks recent system activities across all modules.

## Process Flow (Step by Step)
1. User navigates to `/dashboard` from the main navigation menu
2. System initializes SidebarProvider with custom spacing configuration
3. Dashboard layout renders with DashboardHeader, DashboardCards, DashboardChart, and DashboardDataTable components
4. DashboardCards loads and displays main KPI metrics with trend indicators
5. System calculates percentage changes and displays trending icons (up/down arrows)
6. Status cards section loads with critical alerts and operational status indicators
7. DashboardChart renders three different chart types: Area chart for order trends, Bar chart for spend analysis, Line chart for supplier network growth
8. Chart components use ChartContainer with accessibility layers and interactive tooltips
9. DashboardDataTable loads recent activities data with status and priority color coding
10. Activity table provides dropdown actions for each record (View, Edit, Delete)
11. All components update automatically based on data refresh intervals
12. User can interact with charts through hover tooltips and activity table actions
