## Description
The Carmen ERP Product Management System provides comprehensive product catalog management with sophisticated product profiling, multi-unit conversions, environmental impact tracking, location assignment management, and inventory integration. The system supports complex product configurations including pricing structures, tax management, unit conversions for ordering/inventory/recipes, location-specific parameters, and environmental sustainability metrics. Products can be configured for sale items, ingredients, or both, with complete lifecycle management from creation to discontinuation.

## Process Flow (Step by Step)

### Product Catalog Management
1. User navigates to `/product-management/products` to access product catalog
2. System displays product list with filtering by category, status, and search functionality
3. User can create new products via "Add Product" button or edit existing products
4. Product creation includes comprehensive tabs: General, Inventory, Order Units, Ingredient Units, Locations, Environmental Impact
5. System validates product information including unique product codes and barcode verification
6. Product profile setup includes category assignment, item group classification, and primary unit designation
7. Advanced pricing configuration supports base price, standard cost, tax types, and deviation limits
8. System maintains product relationships with vendors through pricing and procurement integration

### Unit Conversion Management
9. System supports three types of unit conversions: Inventory, Order, and Recipe units
10. Conversion factors enable seamless unit transitions (e.g., KG to Grams, Liters to Bottles)
11. Order units facilitate procurement processes with vendor-specific ordering units
12. Recipe units enable recipe management with precise ingredient measurements
13. System validates conversion factor accuracy and prevents circular conversion chains
14. Bulk conversion updates support mass product unit changes

### Location Assignment System
15. Products can be assigned to multiple storage locations with specific parameters
16. Location assignments include min/max quantities, reorder points, and par levels
17. System tracks location-specific inventory levels and movement restrictions
18. Assignment validation ensures logical min/max relationships and stock level constraints
19. Bulk location assignment supports consistent parameter application across products
20. Integration with inventory management provides real-time location-specific stock updates

### Environmental Impact Tracking
21. System captures comprehensive environmental metrics: carbon footprint, water usage, recyclability
22. Sustainability certifications tracking includes Organic, Fair Trade, MSC, FSC certifications
23. Energy efficiency ratings from A (most efficient) to F (least efficient) classification
24. Biodegradability and packaging recyclability percentages for environmental compliance
25. Environmental reports support sustainability initiatives and regulatory compliance
26. Integration with procurement provides supplier environmental performance tracking

### Category and Classification System
27. Hierarchical category structure supports Category → Subcategory → Item Group organization
28. Dynamic category management allows real-time classification updates
29. Item groups enable cross-category product clustering (e.g., Organic Products, Premium Items)
30. Classification affects reporting, pricing strategies, and procurement workflows
31. Bulk reclassification supports organizational structure changes

## Ambiguities & Assumptions
Assumption: Product codes must be unique across the entire system and cannot be reused even after product deletion.
Assumption: Unit conversion factors are bidirectional and automatically calculate reverse conversions.
Ambiguity: The specific business rules for automatic reorder point calculations based on historical consumption are not defined.
Assumption: Environmental impact metrics are required for sustainability reporting and compliance tracking.
Ambiguity: Integration timing with external systems (POS, e-commerce) for product catalog synchronization needs clarification.
Assumption: Location assignments support both physical locations and virtual/logical location categories.
Assumption: Tax configuration supports multi-jurisdiction tax rules with location-based tax rate determination.
Ambiguity: The exact workflow for handling discontinued products and their impact on existing procurement/inventory processes requires specification.
