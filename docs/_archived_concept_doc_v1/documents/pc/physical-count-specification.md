## Overview

The Physical Count module is a comprehensive inventory management system designed for hospitality environments. It provides a structured workflow for conducting physical inventory counts with multi-step processes, location-based organization, and real-time progress tracking.

## Module Architecture

### Core Components

- **Physical Count Dashboard** - Overview and management interface
- **Active Count Interface** - Real-time counting execution
- **Physical Count Management** - Administrative management of counts

## Physical Count Creation Workflow

### Main Wizard Steps
The physical count creation follows a 4-step wizard pattern:
