## Global Rules

### GR-001: User Preference Override
**Priority**: High
**Category**: Configuration

**Rule**: Individual user notification preferences MUST override global default settings.

**Business Logic**:
- Global defaults apply only to new users or users who haven't customized their preferences
- When a user modifies their personal notification settings, those settings take precedence over global defaults
- System administrators cannot force global settings on users who have customized their preferences

**Example**:
```
Global Default: Purchase Request Approved → Email + In-App
User Preference: Purchase Request Approved → In-App only

Result: User receives In-App notification only
```

**Validation**:
- Check user-specific settings before applying global defaults
- Log when user preferences override global settings

**Exceptions**:
- Critical security notifications (security-alert) bypass user preferences
- System maintenance notifications cannot be disabled by users

---

### GR-002: Permission-Based Access
**Priority**: High
**Category**: Security

**Rule**: Only users with appropriate permissions can modify notification settings.

**Business Logic**:
- `system_administration.settings.notifications.view`: View notification settings
- `system_administration.settings.notifications.manage`: Modify notification settings
- `system_administration.settings.notifications.test`: Send test notifications

**Validation**:
- Permission check required before any save operation
- Audit log created for all configuration changes
- Failed permission checks logged for security monitoring

---

### GR-003: Mandatory Notification Types
**Priority**: High
**Category**: Compliance

**Rule**: Certain notification types CANNOT be completely disabled for compliance and security reasons.

**Mandatory Notifications**:
- `security-alert`: Security-related notifications
- `workflow-assignment`: Task assignments
- `system-maintenance`: Critical system updates

**Business Logic**:
- UI disables the "Disable" toggle for mandatory notifications
- At least one channel must be enabled for mandatory notifications
- Attempt to disable mandatory notifications returns validation error

---

## Notification Delivery Rules

### ND-001: Delivery Attempt Sequence
**Priority**: High
**Category**: Delivery

**Rule**: Notifications MUST be delivered in the order they are created, per user, per channel.

**Business Logic**:
1. Notifications queued in FIFO (First-In-First-Out) order
2. Each channel maintains separate delivery queue
3. Failed deliveries do not block subsequent notifications
4. Retry attempts maintain original queue position

**Example**:
```
Queue: N1 (Email), N2 (Email), N3 (Email)
N1 fails → N2 and N3 proceed
N1 retries after delay without blocking queue
```

---

### ND-002: Multi-Channel Delivery
**Priority**: Medium
**Category**: Delivery

**Rule**: When multiple channels are enabled for an event, ALL enabled channels MUST receive the notification independently.

**Business Logic**:
- Each channel delivery is independent
- Failure in one channel does not affect other channels
- Success/failure tracked separately per channel
- Delivery timestamps recorded per channel

**Example**:
```
Event: Purchase Request Approved
Channels: Email (success) + In-App (success) + SMS (failed)

Result: User sees notification in email and in-app, SMS retry scheduled
```

---

### ND-003: Delivery Confirmation
**Priority**: Medium
**Category**: Delivery

**Rule**: Delivery status MUST be tracked and recorded for all notification attempts.

**Delivery States**:
- `pending`: Queued for delivery
- `sent`: Successfully sent to channel provider
- `delivered`: Confirmed delivery (when available)
- `failed`: Delivery failed
- `bounced`: Recipient rejected (email)

**Business Logic**:
- Webhook callbacks update delivery status
- Timeout period: 5 minutes for email, 1 minute for SMS/Push
- Failed status triggers retry logic
- All status changes logged with timestamp

---

## Channel-Specific Rules

---

## Routing Rules

### RR-001: Rule Evaluation Order
**Priority**: High
**Category**: Routing

**Rule**: Routing rules MUST be evaluated in priority order (High → Medium → Low) until a match is found.

**Business Logic**:
1. Sort rules by priority (High, Medium, Low)
2. Within same priority, sort by creation date (oldest first)
3. Evaluate conditions from top to bottom
4. Stop at first matching rule
5. If no rules match, use default routing

**Example**:
```
Rules:
1. [High] Amount > $10,000 → CFO approval
2. [Medium] Department = Kitchen → Head Chef approval
3. [Low] All others → Department Manager approval

Purchase Request for $15,000 from Kitchen:
→ Matches Rule 1 (High priority) → Routes to CFO
(Rule 2 not evaluated even though it matches)
```

---

### RR-002: Condition Matching
**Priority**: High
**Category**: Routing

**Rule**: ALL conditions in a routing rule MUST be satisfied for the rule to match (AND logic).

**Supported Conditions**:
- Event Type: Specific notification event
- Role: User's primary role
- Department: User's department
- Amount Threshold: Numeric comparison
- Custom Fields: Additional metadata

**Business Logic**:
```typescript
function matchesRule(notification: Notification, rule: RoutingRule): boolean {
  const conditions = rule.conditions;

  if (conditions.eventType && conditions.eventType !== notification.eventType) {
    return false;
  }

  if (conditions.role && !user.roles.includes(conditions.role)) {
    return false;
  }

  if (conditions.department && user.department !== conditions.department) {
    return false;
  }

  if (conditions.amountThreshold && notification.amount < conditions.amountThreshold) {
    return false;
  }

  return true; // All conditions satisfied
}
```

---

### RR-003: Recipient Resolution
**Priority**: High
**Category**: Routing

**Rule**: Routing rules can target roles, specific users, or departments. Recipients MUST be resolved at delivery time.

**Recipient Types**:

1. **Role-Based**
   - Send to all users with specified role
   - Active users only
   - Department context applied if specified

2. **User-Based**
   - Send to specific user IDs
   - User must be active
   - Fallback to manager if user inactive

3. **Department-Based**
   - Send to all users in department
   - Optional role filter within department
   - Hierarchical department support

**Resolution Logic**:
```typescript
function resolveRecipients(rule: RoutingRule): User[] {
  switch (rule.recipients.type) {
    case 'role':
      return getUsersByRole(rule.recipients.values);

    case 'user':
      return getUsersByIds(rule.recipients.values)
        .filter(u => u.isActive);

    case 'department':
      return getUsersByDepartment(rule.recipients.values);
  }
}
```

---

## Template Rules

### TR-001: Variable Substitution
**Priority**: High
**Category**: Templates

**Rule**: All template variables MUST be replaced with actual values before sending notifications.

**Variable Syntax**: `{{variableName}}`

**Standard Variables**:
- `{{userName}}`: Recipient's full name
- `{{documentNumber}}`: Document reference number
- `{{amount}}`: Formatted amount with currency
- `{{requesterName}}`: Name of person who initiated action
- `{{actionDate}}`: Date of action
- `{{actionUrl}}`: Deep link to document

**Business Logic**:
1. Parse template for variable placeholders
2. Validate all required variables have values
3. Apply formatting rules (currency, dates)
4. Replace placeholders with actual values
5. Handle missing variables with fallback text

**Example**:
```
Template:
"Hello {{userName}}, {{requesterName}} submitted {{documentNumber}} for {{amount}}."

Data:
{ userName: "John", requesterName: "Sarah", documentNumber: "PR-12345", amount: "$1,500" }

Output:
"Hello John, Sarah submitted PR-12345 for $1,500."
```

**Fallback Handling**:
```
Missing variable: {{userName}}
Fallback: "Hello, Sarah submitted PR-12345 for $1,500."
```

---

### TR-002: HTML Sanitization
**Priority**: High
**Category**: Security

**Rule**: All user-provided content in templates MUST be sanitized to prevent XSS attacks.

**Sanitization Rules**:
1. Remove all `<script>` tags
2. Remove dangerous attributes (`onclick`, `onerror`, etc.)
3. Allow safe HTML tags (`<p>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<a>`, etc.)
4. Validate URLs in `href` and `src` attributes
5. Encode special characters

**Allowed Tags**:
- Text formatting: `<p>`, `<h1-h6>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<u>`
- Links: `<a href="...">`
- Lists: `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`
- Tables: `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, `<th>`
- Other: `<br>`, `<hr>`, `<div>`, `<span>`

---

## Rate Limiting Rules

### RL-001: Per-User Rate Limits
**Priority**: High
**Category**: Rate Limiting

**Rule**: Individual users MUST NOT receive more notifications than the configured per-user hourly limit.

**Default Limits**:
- Per user per hour: 50 notifications
- Configurable range: 1-1000

**Business Logic**:
1. Track notification count per user per hour (rolling window)
2. Increment counter on each notification attempt
3. If limit reached, queue notification for next hour
4. Reset counter after rolling hour passes
5. Critical notifications exempt from limit

**Example**:
```
Limit: 50 per hour
Current count: 49
New notification arrives → Delivered (count: 50)
Next notification arrives → Queued for next hour

Critical security alert arrives → Delivered immediately (exempt)
```

**Priority Handling**:
- Critical notifications: Bypass limit
- High priority: Delivered if < 90% of limit
- Normal priority: Delivered if < 100% of limit
- Low priority: Queued if at limit

---

### RL-002: Organization Rate Limits
**Priority**: High
**Category**: Rate Limiting

**Rule**: The total number of notifications sent organization-wide MUST NOT exceed the configured hourly limit.

**Default Limits**:
- Organization per hour: 10,000 notifications
- Configurable range: 100-100,000

**Business Logic**:
1. Track total notification count across all users (rolling window)
2. Apply organization limit before per-user limit
3. Priority queuing when approaching limit
4. Administrative notifications prioritized

**Quota Allocation**:
- Critical notifications: 10% of quota reserved
- Administrative: 20% of quota reserved
- User notifications: 70% of quota

**Warning Thresholds**:
- 75% quota used: Warning to administrators
- 90% quota used: Alert to administrators
- 100% quota used: Queue normal priority notifications

---

### RL-003: Channel-Specific Quotas
**Priority**: Medium
**Category**: Rate Limiting

**Rule**: Each notification channel MUST respect its configured daily quota.

**Default Quotas**:
- Email: 100,000 per day
- SMS: 10,000 per day
- Push: 1,000,000 per day
- Webhook: Unlimited

**Business Logic**:
1. Track usage per channel per day
2. Reset quota at midnight UTC
3. Reject delivery when quota exhausted
4. Fall back to alternative channels if configured

**Fallback Logic**:
```
Primary: SMS (quota exhausted)
Fallback: Email (available) → Deliver via email
If Email also exhausted → In-App (available) → Deliver via in-app
```

---

## Escalation Rules

### ER-001: Time-Based Escalation
**Priority**: High
**Category**: Escalation

**Rule**: If a notification requiring action is not acknowledged within the configured time, it MUST be escalated to the next level.

**Escalation Triggers**:
- Workflow approval not actioned
- Critical alert not acknowledged
- Time-sensitive notification ignored

**Business Logic**:
1. Start escalation timer when notification delivered
2. Monitor for acknowledgment/action
3. If no response within delay period, escalate
4. Send notification to escalation recipients
5. Log escalation event
6. Repeat escalation up to 3 levels

**Example**:
```
Purchase Request approval sent to Manager
Delay: 4 hours
No response after 4 hours → Escalate to Department Head
Still no response after 4 more hours → Escalate to CFO
```

**Escalation Levels**:
- Level 1: Direct manager (immediate)
- Level 2: Department head (4 hours)
- Level 3: Executive (8 hours from level 2)

---

### ER-002: Priority-Based Escalation
**Priority**: Medium
**Category**: Escalation

**Rule**: Higher priority notifications have shorter escalation timeframes.

**Escalation Delays by Priority**:
- Critical: 1 hour
- High: 4 hours
- Medium: 8 hours
- Low: 24 hours

**Business Logic**:
- Critical items escalate quickly
- Low priority items allow more time for response
- Manual escalation always allowed
- Weekend/holiday delays configurable

---

## User Preference Rules

### UP-001: Opt-Out Restrictions
**Priority**: High
**Category**: User Preferences

**Rule**: Users MAY opt out of non-critical notifications but MUST receive critical notifications.

**Opt-Out Allowed**:
- Procurement notifications

- System maintenance
- Workflow assignments
- Compliance notifications

**Business Logic**:
```typescript
function canOptOut(eventType: NotificationEventType): boolean {
  const mandatoryTypes = [
    'security-alert',
    'system-maintenance',
    'workflow-assignment',
  ];

  return !mandatoryTypes.includes(eventType);
}
```

---

### UP-002: Frequency Preferences
**Priority**: Medium
**Category**: User Preferences

**Rule**: Users can choose notification frequency for supported event types.

**Frequency Options**:
- **Instant**: Deliver immediately
- **Hourly Digest**: Batch notifications hourly

**Digest Rules**:
1. Collect notifications within time window
2. Combine into single digest message
3. Deliver at scheduled time
4. Include up to 50 notifications per digest
5. Link to view all notifications

**Example Digest**:
```
Daily Digest - October 21, 2025

You have 12 new notifications:
- 5 Purchase Requests pending approval
- 3 Low stock alerts
- 2 Vendor price updates
- 2 Comments on your documents

View all notifications →
```

**Instant Delivery Override**:
- Critical notifications always instant
- User-mentioned notifications always instant
- Workflow assignments always instant

  message: string;
  severity: 'error' | 'warning';
}

function validate(settings: DeliverySettings): ValidationError[] {
  const errors: ValidationError[] = [];

  if (settings.rateLimiting.perUserPerHour < 1) {
    errors.push({
      field: 'rateLimiting.perUserPerHour',
      message: 'Must be at least 1',
      severity: 'error'
    });
  }

  return errors;
