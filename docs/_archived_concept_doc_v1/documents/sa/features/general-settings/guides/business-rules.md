## Compliance & Regulatory Considerations

### GDPR Compliance Rules
- Data retention periods must comply with GDPR requirements
- Audit logs must be accessible for compliance reporting
- Data encryption must meet GDPR security standards
- User consent required for certain data processing activities

### SOC 2 Compliance Rules
- Password policies must meet SOC 2 Type II requirements
- Audit logging must be comprehensive and tamper-proof
- Access controls must enforce least privilege principle
- Encryption standards must meet SOC 2 security criteria

### Industry-Specific Regulations
- **Healthcare (HIPAA)**: Enhanced encryption and audit logging required
- **Finance (PCI DSS)**: Strict password policies and MFA requirements
- **Government**: Additional security controls and access restrictions

## Rule Enforcement Priority

**Priority Levels**:
1. **Critical**: Security, encryption, authentication rules (cannot be bypassed)
2. **High**: Compliance, audit, data integrity rules (should not be bypassed)
3. **Medium**: Operational, format validation rules (warnings allowed)
4. **Low**: Recommendation, optimization rules (informational only)
