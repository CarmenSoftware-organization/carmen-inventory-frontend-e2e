## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Cannot Delete Department

**Solution**: Deactivate department instead or reassign dependencies first

### Issue: Duplicate Department Code
**Cause**: Code already exists in system
**Solution**: Use a different code or edit existing department

### Issue: Head Email Not Saving
**Cause**: Invalid email format
**Solution**: Verify email format is valid (user@domain.com)

### Issue: Department Not Appearing in Dropdowns

**Solution**: Edit department and set Active status to checked
