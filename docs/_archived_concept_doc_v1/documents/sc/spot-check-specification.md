## Overview

The Spot Check module is a core component of Carmen ERP's Inventory Management system designed to facilitate random inventory verification and accuracy checking. It allows authorized personnel to perform targeted inventory counts on specific items or locations to maintain inventory accuracy and identify discrepancies.

### Key Features

- **Random Item Selection**: Automatically select items for spot checking based on criteria
- **High-Value Item Focus**: Target expensive items for more frequent verification
- **Real-time Count Tracking**: Live progress monitoring during active counts
- **Variance Analysis**: Automatic calculation and tracking of inventory discrepancies
- **Dashboard Overview**: Comprehensive monitoring of all spot check activities
- **Multi-user Support**: Role-based access for different user types

### Business Objectives

- Maintain inventory accuracy through regular spot checks
- Identify potential inventory issues before full cycle counts
- Reduce inventory shrinkage through targeted verification
- Improve overall inventory control and visibility

## Data Flow

### Spot Check Creation Flow

1. **User navigates** to `/spot-check/new`
2. **Form renders** with empty state
3. **User selects** counter, department, store, date
4. **System filters** available items based on criteria
5. **Preview updates** with selected items in real-time
6. **User submits** form with validation
7. **System creates** spot check session with unique ID
8. **Navigation redirects** to active count page

### Count Execution Flow

1. **User accesses** active count via `/spot-check/active/[id]`
2. **System loads** session data and selected items
3. **Count form renders** with item listing
4. **User enters** actual counts for each item
5. **System calculates** variance in real-time
6. **User selects** item status (good/damaged/missing/expired)
7. **Progress tracking** updates completion percentage
8. **User submits** individual items or entire session
9. **System saves** count data and updates session status

### Data Persistence

#### Session Storage
- Count sessions persist across browser refreshes
- Form state maintained during navigation
- Progress automatically saved on item submission

#### Mock Data Integration
- Uses centralized mock data from `@/lib/mockData`
- Simulates real database operations
- Maintains data consistency across components
