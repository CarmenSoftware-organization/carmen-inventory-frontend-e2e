## Introduction

The Vendor Pricelist Management Module is a comprehensive system within the Carmen Supply Chain Management System that provides centralized vendor management, pricelist collection, price validity management, and intelligent price assignment capabilities. This feature streamlines all vendor-related pricing processes across the organization, reduces manual work, and improves procurement decision-making by integrating systematic vendor management with intelligent price assignment to Purchase Requests (PRs).

The module operates as a unified system at `app/(main)/vendor-management/` with all vendor and pricing functionality consolidated under a single module. This organizational structure provides a cohesive vendor and pricing hub for all supply chain operations, where all vendor-related capabilities are integrated within a single, intuitive interface.
