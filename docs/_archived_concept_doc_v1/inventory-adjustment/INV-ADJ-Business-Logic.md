## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive inventory management system that supports both FIFO (First-In-First-Out) and Average costing methods. The system is designed to handle various transaction types including receipts, issues, transfers, adjustments, and vendor returns, while maintaining accurate cost tracking and inventory valuation.

## 5. Costing Methods

### FIFO (First-In-First-Out)

- Each receipt creates a new cost layer
- Issues deplete layers in the order they were created
- Supports detailed cost tracking and valuation
- Provides more accurate inventory valuation in inflationary environments
- Requires more detailed record-keeping and processing

### Average Cost

- Calculates a new average cost with each receipt
- All issues use the current average cost
- Simplifies cost tracking but may be less precise for individual transactions
- Reduces the complexity of inventory valuation
- Requires less detailed record-keeping than FIFO
- May be more appropriate for commodities or items with minimal cost variations

## 6. Reporting and Analysis

1. **Inventory Valuation Report**
   - Current value of inventory by item, location, and category
   - Historical valuation trends
   - Comparison of valuation methods (FIFO vs. Average)

2. **Stock Movement Report**
   - Detailed transaction history by item and location
   - Movement analysis by transaction type
   - Trend analysis of stock movements

3. **FIFO Layer Analysis** (for FIFO items)
   - Current FIFO layers by item and location
   - Age analysis of inventory layers
   - Cost variance analysis across layers

4. **Average Cost Trend Analysis** (for Average Cost items)
   - Historical average cost changes
   - Cost trend visualization
   - Impact analysis of new receipts on average cost

5. **Inventory Turnover Report**
   - Turnover ratio by item, category, and location
   - Slow-moving and fast-moving item identification
   - Seasonal turnover patterns

6. **Stock-out Frequency Report**
   - Items with frequent stock-outs
   - Duration of stock-out periods
   - Impact analysis of stock-outs

7. **Vendor Return Analysis**
