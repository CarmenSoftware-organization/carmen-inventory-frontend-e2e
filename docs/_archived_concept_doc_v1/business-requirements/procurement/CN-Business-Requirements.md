### System Calculations Rules (CN_CALC)
- **CN_CALC_001**: Item subtotal = Round(Return Quantity (3 decimals) × Unit Price (2 decimals), 2)
- **CN_CALC_002**: Item discount amount = Round(Round(Subtotal, 2) × Discount Rate, 2)
- **CN_CALC_003**: Item net amount = Round(Round(Subtotal, 2) - Round(Discount Amount, 2), 2)
- **CN_CALC_004**: Item tax amount = Round(Round(Net Amount, 2) × Tax Rate, 2)
- **CN_CALC_005**: Item total = Round(Round(Net Amount, 2) + Round(Tax Amount, 2), 2)
- **CN_CALC_006**: Base currency conversion = Round(Round(Amount, 2) × Exchange Rate (5 decimals), 2)
- **CN_CALC_007**: Return subtotal = Round(Sum of Round(item subtotals, 2), 2)
- **CN_CALC_008**: Return total discount = Round(Sum of Round(item discounts, 2), 2)
- **CN_CALC_009**: Return total tax = Round(Sum of Round(item taxes, 2), 2)

- **CN_CALC_020**: Tax-inclusive price breakdowns must round each component

### Extra Cost Distribution Rules (CN_DIST)
- **CN_DIST_001**: Extra costs must be distributed using one of the following methods:
  - By Value: Round(Round(Item Value, 2) / Round(Total Value, 2) × Extra Cost, 2)
  - By Quantity: Round(Round(Item Quantity, 3) / Round(Total Quantity, 3) × Extra Cost, 2)
  - By Weight: Round(Round(Item Weight, 3) / Round(Total Weight, 3) × Extra Cost, 2)
  - By Volume: Round(Round(Item Volume, 3) / Round(Total Volume, 3) × Extra Cost, 2)
  - Equal Split: Round(Extra Cost / Number of Items, 2)

- **CN_DIST_002**: Distribution rounding rules:
  - Each distribution calculation step must be rounded before use
  - Distribution ratios must sum to 1.0000 (4 decimal places)
  - Any rounding difference must be allocated to the highest value item
  - Negative extra costs must follow the same distribution rules

- **CN_DIST_003**: Extra cost types and sequence:
  - Return freight charges must be distributed first
  - Return insurance costs must be distributed second
  - Return handling charges must be distributed third
  - Return duties must be distributed fourth
  - Other return charges must be distributed last

- **CN_DIST_004**: Return cost calculation:
  - Base return cost = Round(Unit Cost × Return Quantity, 2)
  - Distributed costs = Sum of all Round(distributed extra costs, 2)
  - Total return cost = Round(Base return cost + Distributed costs, 2)
  - Unit return cost = Round(Total return cost / Return Quantity, 5)

- **CN_DIST_005**: Extra cost adjustments:
  - Added extra costs must trigger recalculation of all distributions
  - Removed extra costs must trigger recalculation of all distributions
  - Modified extra costs must trigger recalculation of all distributions
  - Distribution method changes must trigger recalculation

- **CN_DIST_006**: Distribution exclusions:
  - Free of charge returns must be excluded from value-based distribution
  - Zero-quantity returns must be excluded from quantity-based distribution
  - Zero-weight returns must be excluded from weight-based distribution
  - Zero-volume returns must be excluded from volume-based distribution
