## 1. Feature Spec

### 1.1. Introduction

This document outlines the feature specification and functional requirements for the Purchase Requisition (PR) module within the Carmen ERP system. The PR module is a critical component of the procurement process, enabling users to request the purchase of goods and services required for their operations.

### 1.2. Problem Statement

Currently, the process of requesting purchases is manual, leading to inefficiencies, lack of transparency, and a higher risk of errors. There is no standardized system for tracking and managing purchase requests, making it difficult to control budgets and manage approvals.

### 1.3. Goals and Objectives

The primary goal of the PR module is to automate and streamline the purchase requisition process. The objectives are as follows:

*   **Standardize the PR process:** Provide a consistent and user-friendly interface for creating and submitting purchase requests.
*   **Improve transparency:** Enable users to track the status of their PRs throughout the approval workflow.
*   **Enhance control:** Implement a robust approval workflow to ensure that all purchases are properly authorized and within budget.
*   **Reduce errors:** Minimize manual data entry and the risk of human error.
*   **Increase efficiency:** Accelerate the procurement cycle by automating the PR and approval process.

### 1.4. Scope

This document covers the core functionality of the PR module, including:

*   Creating, editing, and submitting purchase requisitions.
*   Configuring and managing multi-level approval workflows.
*   Viewing and tracking the status of PRs.
*   Converting approved PRs into Purchase Orders (POs).
*   Sending notifications related to PR status changes.

### 1.5. User Personas

*   **Requestor:** A staff member who needs to request the purchase of goods or services.
*   **Approver:** A manager or department head responsible for approving purchase requests.
*   **Procurement Officer:** A member of the procurement team responsible for processing approved PRs and converting them into POs.
*   **System Administrator:** Responsible for configuring the PR module, including approval workflows and user permissions.

### 1.6. User Stories

*   As a Requestor, I want to easily create a new purchase requisition with all the necessary details, so that I can quickly request the items I need.
*   As a Requestor, I want to be able to track the status of my purchase requisitions, so that I know when to expect the requested items.
*   As an Approver, I want to receive notifications for pending purchase requisitions, so that I can review and approve them in a timely manner.
*   As an Approver, I want to be able to view all the details of a purchase requisition before approving or rejecting it, so that I can make an informed decision.
*   As a Procurement Officer, I want to be able to convert an approved purchase requisition into a purchase order, so that I can efficiently process the purchase.

### 1.7. Assumptions and Constraints

*   The PR module will be integrated with the existing User Management, Inventory, and Vendor Management modules.
*   The system will support a multi-level approval workflow based on user roles and departments.
*   The initial version will focus on the core functionality described in this document. Advanced features like budget checking and reporting will be considered for future releases.
