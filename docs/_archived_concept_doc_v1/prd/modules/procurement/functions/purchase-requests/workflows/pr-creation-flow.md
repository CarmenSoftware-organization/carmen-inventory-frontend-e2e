- RBAC Service: `/services/rbac-service.ts` (Role-based access control)
- Main Flow Controller: `/PRDetailPage.tsx` (600+ lines of workflow logic)

## 🎯 Primary User Flows

### Flow Categories
1. **Creation Flows**: New PR creation, template usage, bulk import
2. **Approval Flows**: Multi-stage approval with decision logic
3. **Management Flows**: Edit, clone, delete, export operations  
4. **Workflow Flows**: Status transitions and stage management

## 🚀 Flow 1: Purchase Request Creation Flow

### 1.1 Standard PR Creation Flow

```
START: Purchase Requests List Page
    ↓
[Click "New Purchase Request" Dropdown]
    ↓
[Select "Create Blank PR"]
    ↓
NAVIGATE: /procurement/purchase-requests/new?mode=add
    ↓
[PR Creation Form Loads]
    ├── Header Information Entry
    ├── Items Addition (Line-by-line)
    ├── Budget Validation
    └── Attachment Upload
    ↓
[Submit Button Clicked]
    ↓
VALIDATION: Form Validation & Business Rules Check
    ├── SUCCESS → Save PR → Navigate to View Mode
    └── FAILURE → Show Validation Errors → Return to Form
    ↓
END: PR Created Successfully
```

### 1.2 Template-Based Creation Flow

```
START: Purchase Requests List Page
    ↓
[Click "New Purchase Request" Dropdown]
    ↓
[Select Template Option]
    ├── Office Supplies
    ├── IT Equipment  
    ├── Kitchen Supplies
    └── Maintenance
    ↓
NAVIGATE: /procurement/purchase-requests/new?mode=add&template={type}
    ↓
[Pre-populated Form Loads]
    ├── Template Items Auto-loaded
    ├── Default Categories Applied
    └── Standard Approval Workflow Assigned
    ↓
[User Modifications (Optional)]
    ├── Edit Items
    ├── Adjust Quantities/Prices
    └── Add Custom Items
    ↓
[Submit Template-Based PR]
    ↓
END: Template PR Created
```

### 1.3 Creation Flow State Management

**Form State Tracking**:
- `mode` parameter: "add" | "edit" | "view"
- `isAddMode`: Boolean flag for creation mode
- `isDirty`: Tracks unsaved changes
- `validationErrors`: Real-time validation feedback

**Navigation Logic**:
```typescript
// Route Construction
const createRoute = `/procurement/purchase-requests/new?mode=add`
const templateRoute = `${createRoute}&template=${templateType}`

// State Management
const [formData, setFormData] = useState(defaultPRData)
const [isDirty, setIsDirty] = useState(false)
```

## ⚡ Flow 2: Purchase Request Approval Workflow

### 2.1 Multi-Stage Approval Flow

```
START: PR Created (Status: Draft)
    ↓
STAGE 1: Requester Submission
    [Requester Reviews & Submits]
    ├── canSubmit: true
    ├── Action: "Submit for Approval" 
    └── Next: Department Head Approval
    ↓
STAGE 2: Department Head Approval  
    [Department Head Reviews PR]
    ├── APPROVE → Next: Finance Approval (if required)
    ├── REJECT → Status: Rejected, End Flow
    └── SEND BACK → Return to Requester
    ↓
STAGE 3: Finance Approval (Budget-Dependent)
    [Finance Manager Reviews PR]
    ├── APPROVE → Status: Approved, Ready for PO Creation  
    ├── REJECT → Status: Rejected, End Flow
    └── SEND BACK → Return to Previous Stage
    ↓
STAGE 4: Purchasing Processing
    [Purchasing Staff Converts to PO]
    ├── CREATE PO → Status: Converted to PO
    └── CLOSE PR → Status: Completed
    ↓
END: PR Workflow Complete
```

### 2.2 Workflow Decision Engine Logic

**Priority-Based Decision Making**:
```typescript
// Workflow Decision Priority
1. All Rejected → Submit & Reject (Destructive Button)
2. Any Review → Submit & Return (Orange Button)  
3. Any Pending → Review Required (Disabled Button)
4. Any Approved → Submit & Approve (Green Button)
5. No Items → No Items (Disabled Button)
```

**Decision Engine Implementation**:
```typescript
interface WorkflowDecision {
  canSubmit: boolean;
  action: 'approve' | 'reject' | 'return' | 'blocked';
  buttonText: string;
  buttonVariant: 'default' | 'destructive' | 'outline';
  buttonColor?: string;
  reason: string;
  itemsSummary: ItemStatusSummary;
}

// Example Decision Logic
if (summary.rejected === summary.total && summary.total > 0) {
  return {
    canSubmit: true,
    action: 'reject',
    buttonText: 'Submit & Reject',
    buttonVariant: 'destructive',
    reason: 'All items have been rejected'
  };
}
```

### 2.3 Item-Level Approval Flow

```

    case 'financeApproval':  
      return getFinanceManagers(pr.budgetCategory);
    case 'generalManagerApproval':
      return getGeneralManagers(pr.location);

  }
};
```

**Stage Transition Logic**:
```typescript
// Next Stage Calculation
const getNextWorkflowStage = (currentStage: string, pr: PurchaseRequest) => {
  const stageFlow = {
    'requester': 'departmentHeadApproval',
    'departmentHeadApproval': pr.totalAmount > FINANCE_THRESHOLD 
      ? 'financeApproval' : 'completed',
    'financeApproval': pr.totalAmount > GM_THRESHOLD
