## Overview

This workflow manages physical inventory counting processes including cycle counts, full inventory counts, and spot checks. It ensures inventory accuracy, identifies discrepancies, and maintains audit compliance while minimizing operational disruption.

**Purpose**: Provide systematic physical counting processes that verify inventory accuracy, identify discrepancies, and maintain comprehensive audit trails for regulatory compliance and operational excellence.

**Scope**: Covers count planning, team assignment, physical counting, variance analysis, adjustment processing, and performance reporting.

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Count Planning and Scheduling
- **Actor**: Inventory Manager / Planning System
- **Action**: Define count scope (cycle, full, spot), schedule timing, assign counting teams
- **System Response**: Creates count instructions, generates count sheets, assigns locations and items
- **Decision Points**: What count methodology? Which locations/items? When to minimize disruption?
- **Next Step**: Step 2 (Team Preparation)

### Step 2: Count Team Preparation and Training
- **Actor**: Count Supervisors / Counting Teams
- **Action**: Brief teams on procedures, distribute count sheets, verify equipment readiness
- **System Response**: Records team assignments, provides count instructions, tracks preparation status
- **Decision Points**: Are teams properly trained? Is equipment functioning? Are procedures clear?
- **Next Step**: Step 3 (Physical Counting)

### Step 3: Physical Counting Execution
- **Actor**: Counting Teams / Count Supervisors
- **Action**: Perform physical counts, record quantities, note discrepancies and issues
- **System Response**: Captures count data, identifies significant variances, validates completeness
- **Decision Points**: Are counts complete and accurate? Should recounts be performed? Any issues requiring attention?
- **Next Step**: Step 4 (Count Verification)

### Step 4: Count Verification and Recount Processing
- **Actor**: Count Supervisors / Independent Verification Team
- **Action**: Verify count accuracy, perform recounts for significant variances, validate results
- **System Response**: Compares counts to system records, calculates variances, flags items for review
- **Decision Points**: Are variances within acceptable limits? Should additional recounts be performed?
- **Next Step**: Step 5 (Variance Analysis)

### Step 5: Variance Analysis and Investigation
- **Actor**: Inventory Analysts / Management
- **Action**: Investigate significant variances, determine root causes, recommend corrective actions
- **System Response**: Generates variance reports, analyzes trends, calculates financial impact
- **Decision Points**: What are root causes? What corrections are needed? Should processes be improved?
- **Next Step**: Step 6 (Adjustment Processing)

### Step 6: Inventory Adjustment and System Update
- **Actor**: Inventory Management System
- **Action**: Process approved adjustments, update inventory records, calculate financial impact
- **System Response**: Updates all systems, generates adjustment records, maintains audit trails
- **Decision Points**: Are all adjustments accurate? Is financial impact properly recorded?
- **Next Step**: Step 7 (Performance Analysis)

### Step 7: Performance Analysis and Reporting
- **Actor**: Management / Analytics System
- **Action**: Analyze count performance, identify improvement opportunities, generate reports
- **System Response**: Creates performance dashboards, tracks accuracy trends, provides insights
- **Decision Points**: What improvements are needed? Should procedures be updated?
- **Next Step**: Workflow complete, implement improvements

## Error Handling

### Counting Errors: Systematic recount procedures with independent verification
### System Failures: Manual backup processes with full reconciliation  
### Large Variances: Mandatory investigation and management approval
### Equipment Issues: Backup equipment and alternative counting methods

## Integration Points

- **Inventory Systems**: Real-time count data capture and variance calculation
- **Financial Systems**: Automatic adjustment processing and cost impact tracking
- **Quality Management**: Integration with quality issue tracking and resolution
- **Performance Analytics**: Count accuracy trends and improvement recommendations

---

## Performance Metrics

- **Count Accuracy**: ≥ 98% accuracy rate with minimal variances
- **Completion Time**: Cycle counts within 24 hours, full counts within 3 days
- **Variance Resolution**: 90% of variances investigated and resolved within 5 days
- **Process Efficiency**: Continuous improvement in count accuracy and efficiency

---

## Business Rules Integration

- **Count Frequency**: Risk-based counting schedules with high-value item prioritization
- **Variance Thresholds**: Defined acceptable variance limits with escalation procedures
- **Approval Requirements**: Management approval for adjustments above defined thresholds
- **Audit Compliance**: Complete documentation and audit trail maintenance

This workflow ensures inventory accuracy through systematic counting processes while maintaining operational efficiency and regulatory compliance.
