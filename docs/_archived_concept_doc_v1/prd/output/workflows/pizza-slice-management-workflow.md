## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Pizza Readiness Assessment
- **Actor**: Kitchen Staff / Pizza Chef
- **Action**: 
  - Evaluate freshly prepared whole pizzas for slice conversion suitability
  - Check pizza temperature (minimum 140°F for food safety)
  - Assess visual quality, toppings distribution, and structural integrity
  - Verify pizza meets quality standards for customer service
- **System Response**: 
  - Records pizza quality assessment in fractional inventory system
  - Updates pizza status from "PREPARED" to "READY_FOR_CONVERSION"
  - Calculates optimal cutting time based on temperature and quality
  - Displays cutting recommendation and urgency level
- **Decision Points**: 
  - Does pizza meet minimum quality standards for slice conversion?
  - Is pizza at optimal temperature for clean cutting?
  - Should conversion be immediate or delayed?
- **Next Step**: If approved → Step 2 (Preparation for Cutting), If delayed → Monitor and reassess

### Step 2: Pre-Cutting Preparation and Setup
- **Actor**: Kitchen Staff
- **Action**:
  - Sanitize cutting tools and work surfaces according to protocols
  - Set up cutting station with appropriate equipment (pizza wheel, serving boards)
