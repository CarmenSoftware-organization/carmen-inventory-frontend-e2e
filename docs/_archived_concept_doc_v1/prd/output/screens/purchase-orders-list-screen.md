- **Currency Consistency:** All items in a PO must use the same currency
- **Approval Requirements:** POs above certain thresholds require additional approvals
- **Delivery Date Validation:** Delivery dates must be in the future and realistic

- **Linear Progression:** Status changes follow logical sequence (Draft → Open → Sent → Received)
- **Reversibility Rules:** Some status changes can be reversed while others cannot
- **Permission Gates:** Status changes require appropriate user permissions
- **Automatic Updates:** System automatically updates status based on receiving transactions

### Data Validation Rules
- **Required Fields:** PO number, vendor, order date, and at least one line item required
- **Numerical Validation:** Amounts must be positive numbers with proper decimal places
- **Date Validation:** Dates must be valid and follow logical sequence
- **Duplicate Prevention:** System prevents duplicate PO numbers

### Grouping and Consolidation Rules
- **Vendor Consistency:** PRs can only be grouped if they have the same vendor
- **Currency Matching:** PRs must have matching currency to be consolidated
- **Delivery Alignment:** Considers delivery dates when grouping requests
- **Authority Limits:** Respects user authority limits when creating consolidated POs

- **Financial Integration:** Accounting system connections are not yet established

### Known Issues
- **Filter Persistence:** Applied filters reset on page refresh
