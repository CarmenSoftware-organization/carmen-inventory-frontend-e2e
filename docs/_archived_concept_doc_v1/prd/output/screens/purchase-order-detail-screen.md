## Business Rules & Validation

**Field Requirements:**
- Purchase order number is automatically generated for new orders
- Vendor selection is mandatory before order can be sent
- At least one item is required before order completion
- Order date defaults to current date but can be modified
- Currency and exchange rate must be specified for multi-currency orders

**Status Workflow Logic:**
- Draft orders can be edited freely and status changed to any state
- Sent orders require reason for status changes to Voided or Cancelled
- Partial orders automatically update based on goods receipt progress
- Closed orders prevent further modifications except for comments
- Voided and Cancelled orders preserve data but prevent operational changes

**Financial Validation:**
- All monetary calculations automatically update when item details change
- Exchange rate validation ensures reasonable values and prevents zero rates
- Tax and discount percentages must be within acceptable ranges
- Override capabilities allow manual adjustment with audit trail creation
- Base currency conversion maintains precision for financial reporting

**Item Management Rules:**
- Item quantities must be positive values for active orders
- Unit prices support decimal precision for accurate costing
- Tax inclusion settings affect calculation methods appropriately
- Received quantity tracking prevents over-receipt situations
- Inventory information provides context for purchasing decisions

## Current Limitations

**Backend Integration Gaps:**
- Save operations currently log to console instead of persisting to database
- Email functionality displays console output rather than sending actual emails
- Print operations show placeholder implementation without PDF generation
- Export features demonstrate UI flow but don't generate actual files

**Missing Integration Features:**
- Goods receipt integration shows placeholder implementations for receiving workflow
- Vendor communication lacks direct email integration with procurement systems
- Inventory updates don't automatically reflect in stock management systems
- Financial posting requires manual integration with accounting systems

**Placeholder Implementations:**
- Activity log uses mock data instead of real user action tracking
- Related documents tab shows sample data rather than actual document relationships
- User authentication context uses hardcoded values instead of actual user sessions
- Attachment handling demonstrates UI without file storage implementation

**Known Technical Issues:**
- Status change history maintains local state but doesn't persist across sessions
- Comment threading displays in UI but lacks backend conversation management
- Bulk operations on items show UI patterns but need server-side processing
- Real-time updates require polling or websocket implementation for multi-user scenarios
