## Current Limitations

**Prototype Features**:
- Pricelist Templates module shows "Demo Only" functionality with no backend integration

- Analytics & Reports section disabled with "Coming Soon" status

**Development Gaps**:
- Advanced vendor analytics not yet implemented
- Automated pricing campaign management requires development
- Real-time reporting features planned but not available
- Integration with external vendor systems pending

**Data Limitations**:
- Quick stats show static mock data rather than dynamic database queries
- Prototype features display sample data only
- Future features section indicates planned functionality without implementation timeline

**Integration Constraints**:
- Price management features isolated from procurement workflow
- Vendor portal integration requires additional development
- Advanced automation features depend on future AI implementation
- Cross-module reporting capabilities limited in current implementation

The Vendor Management Overview Screen successfully provides a comprehensive dashboard for vendor relationship management while clearly distinguishing between production-ready features and development prototypes. The interface effectively guides users to available functionality while transparently communicating the current implementation status of advanced features.
