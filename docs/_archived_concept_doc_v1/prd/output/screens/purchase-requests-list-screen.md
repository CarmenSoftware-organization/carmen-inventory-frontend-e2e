## Current Limitations

**Backend Integration**:
- Currently uses mock data (mockPRListData) instead of live API integration
- Approval actions (approve, reject, delete) only show console.log outputs
- Real-time updates not implemented - requires manual refresh
- No actual data persistence for filter preferences or user settings

**Workflow Integration**:
- Approval workflow stages are displayed but not fully functional
- Email notifications and workflow automation not implemented
- Real-time status updates not available
- Approval routing logic uses placeholder implementation

**Advanced Features**:
- Bulk operations beyond selection not fully implemented
- Advanced reporting and analytics features pending
- Integration with purchase order creation process incomplete
- Document attachment and file management not integrated

**Performance Considerations**:
- Large dataset handling not optimized - pagination is basic
- Search functionality is client-side only
- Advanced filtering may impact performance with large datasets
- Real-time collaboration features not implemented
