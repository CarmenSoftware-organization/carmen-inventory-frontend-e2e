The screen supports both approval workflows and operational tracking of item transfers between stores and departments.

## Business Rules & Validation

### Field Requirements
- **Mandatory Fields**: Requisition date, requested from location, requesting department, and at least one item are required
- **Reference Generation**: System automatically generates sequential requisition numbers (SR-YYYY-NNN format)
- **Location Validation**: Source and destination locations must be different and both must be active
- **Department Assignment**: Requesting department must match user's current department context

### Validation Rules
- **Status Transition Logic**: Requisitions can only move forward through defined workflow stages or be returned to previous stages
- **Approval Hierarchy**: Each approval stage must be completed before proceeding to the next stage
- **Budget Validation**: Financial limits enforced based on user role and department budget allocations
- **Inventory Checking**: System validates item availability at source location before approval

### Workflow Logic
- **Draft to Submission**: Requisitions must have complete item details and valid approvers assigned
- **Approval Sequence**: Standard sequence is Submission → HOD Approval → Store Manager Approval → Complete
- **Return Mechanism**: Any approver can return requisition to previous stage with mandatory comments
- **Rejection Processing**: Rejected requisitions require comments and are returned to draft status for revision

## Current Limitations

### Placeholder Features
- **Search Functionality**: Search input field exists but only performs console logging, no actual filtering implementation
- **Sort Implementation**: Column headers show sort indicators but sorting logic only logs to console
- **Filter Application**: Advanced filter builder collects conditions but application logic is placeholder
- **Export Function**: Export button present but only logs action, no actual export generation

### Missing Integration
- **Backend API**: All data is currently mock data with no real database connectivity
- **User Authentication**: No real role-based access control integration with authentication system
- **Notification System**: No real-time notifications for approval status changes or workflow updates
- **Audit Logging**: Activity logging only includes mock data, no persistent audit trail

### Known Issues
- **Pagination Logic**: Fixed mock data with client-side pagination, no server-side data loading
- **Real-time Updates**: No web socket or polling for real-time status updates
- **Mobile Optimization**: While responsive, some advanced filtering features may be difficult to use on very small screens
- **Performance**: All filtering and sorting is client-side, may not scale with large data sets

## Integration Points

### Inventory Management
- **Stock Validation**: Integration needed with inventory system to check availability before approval
- **Automatic Deduction**: Approved requisitions should automatically reduce source location inventory
- **Lot Tracking**: Integration with lot management for items requiring batch tracking

### Approval Workflow Engine
- **Dynamic Routing**: Integration needed with configurable approval workflow engine
- **Notification Triggers**: Automatic notifications to approvers when requisitions require attention
- **Escalation Rules**: Time-based escalation when approvals are pending beyond defined thresholds

### Financial System
- **Budget Checking**: Real-time budget validation against department and project budgets
- **Cost Center Assignment**: Integration with financial dimension for proper cost allocation
- **Accounting Integration**: Automatic journal entry generation for inventory transfers

### User Management
- **Role Validation**: Dynamic permission checking based on current user context and role assignments
- **Department Security**: Enforcement of department-based access restrictions
- **Location Security**: Validation of user access to source and destination locations

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Implementation needed for large requisition lists with progressive loading
- **Search Optimization**: Server-side search implementation with proper indexing
- **Caching Strategy**: Client-side caching for frequently accessed reference data

### Accessibility Compliance
- **Screen Reader Support**: All interactive elements include proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility for all actions and navigation
- **Color Contrast**: Status badges and indicators meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus handling for modal dialogs and dropdown menus

### Mobile Responsiveness
- **Touch Optimization**: All interactive elements sized appropriately for touch interaction
- **Gesture Support**: Swipe gestures for card navigation and selection
- **Responsive Tables**: Horizontal scrolling with sticky columns for table view on mobile devices
- **Modal Adaptation**: Full-screen modals on small screens with appropriate close affordances
