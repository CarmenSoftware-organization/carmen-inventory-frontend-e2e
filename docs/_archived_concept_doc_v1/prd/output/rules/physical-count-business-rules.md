## Overview

This document defines business rules for managing physical inventory counts within the Carmen ERP system, including cycle counting, annual counts, count accuracy requirements, and variance management for hospitality operations.

## Core Business Rules

### Rule 1: Count Scheduling and Planning

**Description**: Establishes systematic scheduling for physical counts based on inventory value, movement velocity, and regulatory requirements.

**Trigger**: Count scheduling cycles, inventory risk assessment, or regulatory compliance requirements

**Business Logic**: 
- High-value items (>$1,000) counted monthly through cycle count program
- Fast-moving items counted quarterly to maintain accuracy
- Slow-moving items counted semi-annually with special attention to obsolescence
- Annual wall-to-wall count conducted during low-activity periods

**Validation Rules**:
- ABC analysis determines count frequency: A-items monthly, B-items quarterly, C-items semi-annually
- Count scheduling avoids peak operational periods and delivery dates
- Minimum 48-hour notice required for scheduled counts
- Count team assignments based on experience and product knowledge

**Exception Handling**: 
- Operational conflicts may require count rescheduling with management approval
- Urgent count needs override standard scheduling with proper justification
- Staff unavailability requires alternative counter assignment

### Rule 2: Count Execution Standards

**Description**: Establishes procedures and standards for accurate and efficient physical count execution.

**Trigger**: Count initiation, count execution, or quality verification requirements

**Business Logic**: 
- Two-person counting teams for high-value items and accuracy verification
- Count sheets include item descriptions, units of measure, and location details
- Blind count method used to prevent bias from system quantities
- Count timing coordinated to minimize operational disruption

**Validation Rules**:
- Counter identification recorded for accountability and quality tracking
- Count documentation complete with date, time, and signature
- Recount required when initial counts differ by >5% or >$50
- Count cutoff procedures ensure inventory movement control during counting

**Exception Handling**: 
- Counter disagreements resolved through third-party recount
- Missing items investigated immediately during count process
- Count interruptions require restart with fresh count sheets

### Rule 3: Count Accuracy and Verification

**Description**: Ensures count accuracy through verification procedures and statistical validation methods.

**Trigger**: Count completion, accuracy verification, or variance analysis

**Business Logic**: 
- Statistical sampling used to verify count accuracy for large inventories
- High-value items receive 100% verification through supervisor recount
- Count accuracy targets: ±2% for quantities, ±1% for values
- Accuracy performance tracked by counter for training and development

**Validation Rules**:
- Verification sample size minimum 10% of total items or statistical significance
- Supervisor verification required for items >$500 value
- Accuracy measurements exclude items with known issues or special circumstances
- Counter performance ratings based on rolling 90-day accuracy history

**Exception Handling**: 
- Accuracy failures require immediate recount and investigation
- Repeated accuracy issues trigger additional training requirements
- System accuracy problems may require process review and improvement

## Variance Management

### Rule 4: Variance Investigation Requirements

**Description**: Establishes systematic investigation procedures for inventory count variances to identify root causes and prevent recurrence.

**Trigger**: Variance identification, investigation initiation, or resolution requirements

**Business Logic**: 
- Variances >$100 or >5% require formal investigation with documented findings
- Investigation includes review of recent transactions, movements, and system data
- Root cause analysis identifies system, process, or human factors
- Corrective action plans developed and implemented based on findings

**Validation Rules**:
- Investigation initiated within 24 hours of variance identification
- Investigation documentation includes evidence review and conclusion
- Root cause categories tracked for pattern identification
- Corrective actions implemented within 30 days with effectiveness verification

**Exception Handling**: 
- Complex investigations may require extended timeframes with management approval
- Inconclusive investigations documented with additional monitoring requirements
- System-related variances may require technical support involvement

### Rule 5: Adjustment Authorization and Processing

**Description**: Manages the authorization and processing of inventory adjustments resulting from physical count variances.

**Trigger**: Variance resolution, adjustment recommendation, or approval workflow

**Business Logic**: 
- Adjustment authorization levels based on variance amount and type
- Small variances (<$25) auto-approved after investigation
- Significant adjustments require management approval with business justification
- Batch processing of annual count adjustments with comprehensive review

**Validation Rules**:
- Authorization levels: Supervisor ($100), Manager ($500), Director ($2,000), CFO (unlimited)
- Adjustment documentation includes count evidence and investigation results
- Cost impact analysis completed before adjustment processing
- Financial statement impact assessed for material adjustments

**Exception Handling**: 
- Authorization delays may require temporary adjustment holds
- Disputed adjustments escalated for senior management review
- System processing errors require manual adjustment with audit trail

### Rule 6: Systematic Error Identification

**Description**: Identifies and addresses systematic errors in inventory management through count variance analysis.

**Trigger**: Pattern analysis, trend identification, or systematic review requirements

**Business Logic**: 
- Variance patterns analyzed monthly for systematic error identification
- Common error types tracked: transaction errors, system issues, process failures
- Error prevention measures implemented based on analysis results
- System improvements prioritized based on error frequency and impact

**Validation Rules**:
- Pattern analysis includes minimum 30 days of variance data
- Error categorization follows standardized taxonomy for consistency
- Prevention measures include specific goals and success metrics
- System improvements tracked from implementation through effectiveness verification

**Exception Handling**: 
- Complex patterns may require specialized analysis or external consultation
- System limitations may require workaround procedures until resolution
- Process changes require training and communication programs

## Technology Integration

### Rule 7: Mobile Count Technology

**Description**: Leverages mobile technology for efficient and accurate physical count execution and real-time data capture.

**Trigger**: Technology deployment, count execution, or system integration requirements

**Business Logic**: 
- Mobile devices enable real-time count data entry and validation
- Barcode scanning reduces data entry errors and improves efficiency
- Online validation provides immediate feedback on significant variances
- Offline capability ensures count continuation during network issues

**Validation Rules**:
- Mobile device battery life adequate for complete count session
- Barcode scanning accuracy >99.5% with manual entry backup
- Real-time validation rules configured to flag unusual counts
- Offline data synchronization completed within 1 hour of network restoration

**Exception Handling**: 
- Technology failures require immediate backup count procedures
- Scanning errors prompt manual verification and system correction
- Network issues activate offline mode with subsequent data synchronization

### Rule 8: Count Data Integration

**Description**: Ensures accurate and timely integration of count data with inventory management and financial systems.

**Trigger**: Count completion, data processing, or system synchronization requirements

**Business Logic**: 
- Count data integrated with inventory system within 4 hours of completion
- Financial impact calculations completed automatically with adjustment processing
- Audit trail maintained for all count data and system changes
- Exception reporting identifies integration issues for immediate resolution

**Validation Rules**:
- Data integration accuracy verified through systematic validation checks
