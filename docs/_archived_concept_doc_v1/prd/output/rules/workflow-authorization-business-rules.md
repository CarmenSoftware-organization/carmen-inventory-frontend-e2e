## Overview

This document defines business rules for workflow authorization within the Carmen ERP system, ensuring appropriate approval processes, delegation management, escalation procedures, and audit compliance for hospitality operations.

## Core Business Rules

### Rule 1: Workflow Definition and Configuration

**Description**: Establishes standardized approval workflows with appropriate authorization levels and process controls.

**Business Logic**: 
- Workflows defined based on transaction type, value, and risk assessment
- Approval levels determined by organizational hierarchy and authorization limits
- Parallel and serial approval paths configured based on business requirements
- Workflow versioning maintains historical approval process documentation

**Validation Rules**:
- Maximum workflow steps limited to 7 levels to ensure processing efficiency
- Approval timeout periods defined: Standard (48 hours), Rush (4 hours), Emergency (1 hour)
- Workflow activation requires business process owner approval
- Version control maintains complete workflow change history

**Exception Handling**: 
- Workflow configuration errors block activation until correction
- Timeout violations trigger automatic escalation to next approval level
- Version conflicts require immediate resolution through authorized workflow administrator

### Rule 2: Authorization Level Management

**Description**: Manages authorization levels across different transaction types and organizational positions.

**Business Logic**: 
- Authorization matrices define spending limits per role and transaction category
- Cumulative authorization tracking prevents circumvention through transaction splitting
- Temporary authorization increases available for business coverage needs
- Emergency authorization overrides available with comprehensive audit trail

**Validation Rules**:
- Individual authorization limits: Staff ($500), Supervisor ($2,000), Manager ($10,000), Director ($50,000), VP ($100,000)
- Cumulative period limits: Daily (2x individual), Weekly (5x individual), Monthly (10x individual)
- Temporary increases limited to 150% of standard authority for maximum 30 days
- Emergency overrides require CFO approval and 24-hour post-validation

**Exception Handling**: 
- Authorization limit breaches trigger automatic escalation to next level
- Cumulative limit violations require higher-level approval with justification
- Temporary authorization abuse results in immediate limit reduction

### Rule 3: Delegation and Proxy Management

**Description**: Manages delegation of approval authority during absences and provides proxy approval capabilities.

**Business Logic**: 
- Delegation authority transferred to designated approvers during planned absences
- Proxy approvals available for unplanned absences with notification procedures
- Delegation scope limited to delegator's authority level and transaction types
- Automatic reversion of delegation authority upon return from absence

**Validation Rules**:
- Delegation setup required minimum 24 hours before absence start
- Proxy authority limited to 80% of original approver's limits
- Maximum delegation period: 30 days for planned absences, 7 days for proxy
- Delegation documentation includes scope, duration, and business justification

**Exception Handling**: 
- Delegation failures require immediate alternative approver assignment
- Proxy authority abuse triggers immediate revocation and investigation
- Extended absences may require permanent authority reassignment

## Approval Process Management

### Rule 4: Sequential Approval Workflows

**Description**: Manages sequential approval processes where multiple approvals are required in specific order.

**Business Logic**: 
- Sequential approvals follow predetermined hierarchy and authorization levels
- Current approval step blocks subsequent steps until completion
- Approval documentation includes reviewer comments and decision rationale
- Process tracking provides visibility into approval status and bottlenecks

**Validation Rules**:
- Sequential order enforced through system controls preventing skip-ahead approvals
- Approval step completion within defined timeframes to maintain process flow
- Documentation requirements increase with approval level and transaction value
- Status tracking accessible to requestor and all workflow participants

**Exception Handling**: 
- Approval bottlenecks trigger escalation procedures and alternative routing
- Process failures require restart from appropriate workflow step
- Documentation deficiencies may delay approval until completion

### Rule 5: Parallel Approval Workflows

**Description**: Manages parallel approval processes where multiple approvals are required simultaneously.

**Business Logic**: 
- Parallel approvals initiated simultaneously to multiple authorized approvers
- All required approvals must be obtained before workflow completion
- Approval conflicts resolved through designated conflict resolution procedures
- Process efficiency optimized through simultaneous rather than sequential review

**Validation Rules**:
- All parallel approvers must complete review within standard timeframes
- Conflict resolution procedures activated when approvers disagree
- Minimum approval threshold (e.g., 2 of 3 approvers) available for specific workflows
- Process completion requires confirmation from all required approvers

**Exception Handling**: 
- Approver unavailability triggers automatic delegation or alternative assignment
- Approval conflicts escalate to senior management for resolution
- Threshold approvals require documentation of non-participating approver justification

### Rule 6: Conditional Approval Logic

**Description**: Implements conditional approval requirements based on transaction characteristics and business rules.

**Business Logic**: 
- Approval requirements vary based on transaction amount, type, vendor, or other criteria
- Risk-based approval adds additional steps for high-risk transactions
- Seasonal or promotional approvals accommodate business cycle requirements
- Integration with budget controls adds approval steps for budget variances

**Validation Rules**:
- Conditional logic tested and verified before implementation
- Risk assessment criteria clearly defined and consistently applied
- Seasonal approval adjustments communicated 30 days in advance
- Budget integration accuracy verified through monthly reconciliation

**Exception Handling**: 
- Logic errors require immediate correction and affected transaction review
- Risk assessment failures may require manual approval process override
- Seasonal adjustment errors addressed through expedited correction procedures

## Escalation and Exception Management

### Rule 7: Automatic Escalation Procedures

**Description**: Implements automatic escalation when approval timeframes are exceeded or approvers are unavailable.

**Business Logic**: 
- Escalation triggers activated when approval timeframes exceed defined limits
- Escalation hierarchy follows organizational structure with appropriate authority levels
- Notification procedures alert escalated approvers and original requestors
- Escalation tracking maintains complete audit trail of approval process

**Validation Rules**:
- Escalation timeframes: Standard (48 hours), Rush (4 hours), Emergency (1 hour)
- Escalation hierarchy verified monthly against current organizational structure
- Notification delivery confirmed within 15 minutes of escalation trigger
- Audit trail completeness maintained at 100% for escalated approvals

**Exception Handling**: 
- Escalation system failures require immediate manual intervention
- Notification delivery failures trigger alternative communication methods
- Audit trail gaps require investigation and documentation of corrective actions

### Rule 8: Emergency Approval Procedures

**Description**: Provides emergency approval capabilities for urgent business requirements while maintaining control integrity.

**Business Logic**: 
- Emergency approvals available for critical operational needs
- Higher authority levels required for emergency approval authorization
- Post-approval validation required within 24 hours of emergency processing
- Emergency usage monitoring prevents abuse and ensures appropriate utilization

**Validation Rules**:
- Emergency approval authority limited to Director level and above
- Emergency usage limited to 5% of total approvals per month per approver
- Post-approval validation includes business justification and process compliance
- Usage monitoring includes trend analysis and abuse detection

**Exception Handling**: 
- Emergency approval abuse triggers immediate authority suspension
- Post-approval validation failures may require transaction reversal
- Usage pattern anomalies prompt investigation and corrective action

### Rule 9: Rejection and Resubmission Management

**Description**: Manages approval rejections and provides structured resubmission processes.

**Business Logic**: 
- Rejection reasons documented with specific improvement requirements
- Resubmission processes incorporate previous reviewer feedback
- Multiple rejection tracking identifies systemic issues requiring process improvement
- Rejection analytics provide insights for process optimization and training needs

**Validation Rules**:
- Rejection documentation includes specific, actionable improvement requirements
- Resubmission must address all previous rejection reasons
- Maximum 3 rejection cycles before escalation to senior management
- Analytics updated monthly with trend analysis and improvement recommendations

**Exception Handling**: 
- Unclear rejection reasons require clarification before resubmission acceptance
- Resubmission failures beyond limits trigger process review and improvement
- Analytics discrepancies require data verification and correction
