## Core Business Rules

### Rule 1: Adjustment Authorization Requirements

**Description**: Establishes authorization levels and approval requirements for inventory adjustments based on value and type.

**Trigger**: Adjustment entry, value calculation, or approval workflow initiation

**Business Logic**: 
- Positive adjustments >$100 require supervisor approval
- Negative adjustments >$50 require manager approval  
- Write-offs >$500 require director approval with detailed justification
- System-generated adjustments from physical counts auto-approved if within tolerance

**Validation Rules**:
- Adjustment reason codes mandatory for all manual adjustments
- Supporting documentation required for adjustments >$200
- Dual approval required for adjustments >$2,000
- Time limits: Approval within 24 hours, implementation within 48 hours

**Exception Handling**: 
- Emergency adjustments allowed with post-approval within 4 hours
- Rejected adjustments require correction or additional justification
- System failures activate manual approval with audit trail documentation

### Rule 2: Physical Count Integration

**Description**: Manages adjustments resulting from physical inventory counts with accuracy requirements and investigation protocols.

**Trigger**: Physical count completion, variance calculation, or count verification

**Business Logic**: 
- Physical count variances auto-generate adjustment recommendations
- Count accuracy verified through recount procedures for high-value variances
- Cycle count adjustments processed immediately upon verification
- Annual count adjustments batched and processed systematically

**Validation Rules**:
- Recount required for variances >5% or >$100 per item
- Count documentation includes counter identification and timestamp
- Variance investigations completed within 72 hours of count
- Adjustment accuracy verified through statistical sampling

**Exception Handling**: 
- Significant variances trigger immediate investigation before adjustment
- Counter errors require retraining and enhanced supervision
- Systemic count issues may require process review and improvement

### Rule 3: Cost Impact Management

**Description**: Ensures accurate cost calculation and financial impact assessment for all inventory adjustments.

**Trigger**: Cost calculation, financial impact assessment, or accounting period processing

**Business Logic**: 
- Adjustment costs calculated using current standard or average cost

- Write-off costs expensed immediately to designated expense accounts
- Cost variance analysis conducted monthly for trend identification

**Validation Rules**:
- Cost calculations accurate within ±$1 or 1% of adjustment value
- Cost center allocations verified against organizational structure
- Write-off documentation includes business justification and approval
- Variance analysis identifies patterns requiring management attention

**Exception Handling**: 
- Cost calculation errors require immediate correction and reprocessing
- Allocation errors corrected through journal entry adjustments
- Unusual cost patterns trigger investigation and corrective action

## Adjustment Categories

### Rule 4: Damage and Spoilage Adjustments

**Description**: Manages inventory adjustments for damaged, spoiled, or expired products with proper documentation and analysis.

**Trigger**: Damage identification, spoilage detection, or expiration monitoring

**Business Logic**: 
- Damage adjustments categorized by cause (handling, transport, storage, etc.)
- Spoilage tracking includes root cause analysis and preventive measures
- Expiration adjustments trigger review of ordering patterns and rotation procedures
- Insurance claims processed for significant damage adjustments

**Validation Rules**:
- Photographic documentation required for damage adjustments >$50
- Spoilage rates monitored against industry benchmarks and internal targets
- Expiration adjustments analyzed for purchasing pattern optimization
- Insurance claim documentation complete and submitted timely

**Exception Handling**: 
- Excessive damage rates trigger handling procedure review
- Unusual spoilage patterns may indicate storage or supplier issues
- High expiration rates require inventory management process improvement

### Rule 5: Theft and Loss Adjustments

**Description**: Handles inventory adjustments for theft, loss, and mysterious disappearances with security and investigation protocols.

**Trigger**: Loss identification, security incidents, or unexplained inventory shortages

**Business Logic**: 
- Theft adjustments require security incident reports and investigation
- Mysterious losses investigated before adjustment approval
- High-value losses require police reporting and insurance notification
- Loss patterns analyzed for security improvement opportunities

**Validation Rules**:
- Security incident documentation required for suspected theft
- Investigation reports complete before adjustment processing
- Police reports required for losses >$1,000
- Loss trend analysis conducted quarterly

**Exception Handling**: 
- Security breaches trigger immediate investigation and corrective action
- Repeated loss patterns may indicate internal security issues
- High-value losses require comprehensive investigation before adjustment

### Rule 6: System and Data Correction Adjustments

**Description**: Manages adjustments required to correct system errors, data entry mistakes, and technical issues.

**Trigger**: System error identification, data verification, or technical issue resolution

**Business Logic**: 
- System error adjustments documented with technical root cause analysis
- Data entry corrections include user identification and training needs assessment
- Technical issue adjustments processed after system problem resolution
- Error prevention measures implemented based on adjustment analysis

**Validation Rules**:
