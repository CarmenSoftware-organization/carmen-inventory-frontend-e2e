## Overview

This document defines business rules for role-based access control within the Carmen ERP system, ensuring appropriate security, data protection, operational efficiency, and compliance with privacy regulations for hospitality operations.

## Core Business Rules

### Rule 1: Role Definition and Assignment

**Description**: Establishes standardized roles with appropriate permissions and systematic assignment procedures.

**Business Logic**: 
- Roles defined based on job functions with principle of least privilege
- Permission sets assigned to roles rather than individual users
- Role hierarchy enables inheritance of permissions from lower-level roles

- Role assignments require manager approval and HR verification
- Temporary assignments limited to 90 days with automatic expiration
- Role conflicts detected and prevented through automated validation

**Exception Handling**: 
- Role conflicts require immediate resolution through role modification or user assignment change
- Emergency role assignments available with post-approval within 24 hours
- System conflicts trigger automatic user account suspension until resolution

### Rule 2: Permission Granularity and Control

**Description**: Implements fine-grained permission controls across system functions, data access, and operational capabilities.

**Business Logic**: 
- Permissions defined at function level (read, write, delete, approve)
- Data access controlled by location, department, and sensitivity level
- Operational permissions aligned with job responsibilities and business requirements
- Administrative permissions restricted to qualified IT and management personnel

**Validation Rules**:
- Critical permissions require dual approval (create + approve workflow)
- Data access permissions verified monthly through automated compliance checks
- Administrative access limited to minimum necessary personnel

**Exception Handling**: 
- Critical permission violations trigger immediate account suspension
- Data access violations initiate investigation and compliance review
- Administrative access abuse results in immediate revocation and disciplinary action

### Rule 3: Segregation of Duties Enforcement

**Description**: Enforces segregation of duties principles to prevent fraud and ensure operational integrity.

**Business Logic**: 
- Conflicting duties identified and prevented through role-based controls
- Transaction approval workflows require different users for initiation and approval

- System administration functions segregated from business operations

**Validation Rules**:
- Segregation matrix defines incompatible combinations and preventive controls
- Workflow violations automatically blocked with management notification
- Financial control violations prevented through system-enforced checkpoints
- Administrative segregation verified through quarterly access reviews

**Exception Handling**: 
- Segregation violations require immediate investigation and control remediation
- Emergency overrides available with CFO approval and comprehensive audit trail
- System failures may require temporary manual controls until resolution

## Access Control Implementation

### Rule 4: Location-Based Access Control

**Description**: Controls access to data and functions based on user location assignments and geographic restrictions.

**Business Logic**: 
- Users granted access only to assigned locations and authorized areas
- Cross-location access requires business justification and manager approval
- Geographic restrictions prevent access from unauthorized IP addresses or regions
- Mobile access controlled through device registration and location verification

**Validation Rules**:
- Location assignments verified monthly against HR records and job requirements
- Cross-location access reviewed quarterly for continued business need
- IP address restrictions updated within 24 hours of location changes
- Mobile device registration includes security validation and device management

**Exception Handling**: 
- Unauthorized location access triggers immediate session termination and investigation
- Geographic violations may indicate security breach requiring emergency response
- Mobile device security failures result in immediate device suspension

### Rule 5: Time-Based Access Controls

**Description**: Implements time-based access restrictions aligned with business hours and operational schedules.

**Business Logic**: 
- Standard access hours defined per role with business hour alignment
- Extended hours access available for management and operational roles
- After-hours access requires additional authentication and logging
- Seasonal and holiday schedule adjustments applied automatically

**Validation Rules**:
- Business hours defined per location with automatic daylight saving time adjustment
- Extended access limited to roles requiring operational flexibility
- After-hours authentication includes secondary verification factor
- Schedule changes communicated 48 hours in advance with user notification

**Exception Handling**: 
- After-hours access violations trigger security alerts and investigation
- Emergency access available with incident documentation and follow-up review
- Schedule conflicts resolved through role modification or exception approval

### Rule 6: Data Classification and Protection

**Description**: Implements data classification scheme with appropriate protection controls based on sensitivity and regulatory requirements.

**Business Logic**: 
- Data classified as Public, Internal, Confidential, or Restricted
- Protection controls escalate based on classification level
- Personal data subject to privacy regulations receives enhanced protection
- Financial data access restricted to qualified personnel with business need

**Validation Rules**:
- Data classification applied consistently across all system components
- Protection controls verified through automated security scanning
- Privacy regulation compliance validated through quarterly assessments
- Financial data access reviewed monthly with exception reporting

**Exception Handling**: 
- Classification errors require immediate correction and impact assessment
- Protection control failures trigger security incident response procedures
- Privacy violations may require regulatory notification and remediation

## User Lifecycle Management

### Rule 7: User Provisioning and Deprovisioning

**Description**: Manages user account lifecycle from creation through termination with appropriate security and audit controls.

**Business Logic**: 
- New user accounts provisioned based on job role with manager approval
- Account activation requires completion of security training and policy acknowledgment
- Role changes processed within 24 hours with appropriate access adjustments
- Account termination processed immediately upon employment end with complete access removal

**Validation Rules**:
- Account provisioning requires HR verification and manager authorization
- Security training completion verified before system access granted
- Role change requests include business justification and approval documentation
- Termination processing includes comprehensive access review and asset recovery

**Exception Handling**: 
- Provisioning errors require immediate correction and access verification
- Training completion delays may require temporary restricted access
- Termination processing failures trigger manual verification and correction

### Rule 8: Password and Authentication Management

**Description**: Establishes password requirements and multi-factor authentication controls for secure system access.

**Business Logic**: 
- Password complexity requirements enforced with regular update cycles
- Multi-factor authentication required for administrative and high-privilege access
- Single sign-on integration reduces password management overhead
- Account lockout procedures protect against brute force attacks

**Validation Rules**:
- Password requirements: 12+ characters, mixed case, numbers, special characters
- MFA required for users with financial, administrative, or sensitive data access
- SSO integration tested monthly with fallback authentication procedures
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts with 15-minute lockout period

**Exception Handling**: 
- Password policy violations prevented through real-time validation
- MFA failures may indicate security compromise requiring investigation
- SSO failures activate backup authentication with user notification
