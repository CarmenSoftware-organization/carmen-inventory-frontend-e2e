#### **Workflow & Process Rules**

**Sequence Requirements**:

*Mandatory Stage Progression*:
- All workflows must begin with Request Creation stage where requestor provides complete information
- Purchasing Review must occur before Department Approval in General Purchase workflows
- Finance Review cannot be bypassed for any request exceeding departmental approval limits
- Completed stage marks workflow conclusion and prevents further modifications

*Stage Completion Validation*:
- Each workflow stage must receive explicit approval or rejection before progression
- Incomplete stages block advancement to subsequent approval levels
- System validates that all required fields and attachments are provided before stage completion
- Approval actions must include approver identification and timestamp for audit trail

**Status Progression**:

*Request Status Management*:
- **Draft**: Allows unlimited modifications by requestor before submission
- **Submitted**: Locks basic request information and initiates workflow processing
- **InProgress**: Indicates active review and approval processing
- **Completed**: Indicates successful approval and authorization for procurement
- **Rejected**: Stops workflow processing and returns request to requestor

*Workflow Status Tracking*:
- **Pending**: Indicates awaiting action from assigned approver
- **Approved**: At stage level advances request to next workflow stage
- **Rejected**: At stage level can return request to previous stage or requestor
- System maintains complete status history for audit and tracking purposes

**Escalation Triggers**:

*Service Level Agreement Enforcement*:
- Request Creation stage must be completed within 4 hours for General Purchase workflows
- Purchasing Review must be completed within 8 hours of assignment
- Department Approval must be completed within 12 hours of routing
- Finance Review must be completed within 24 hours for requests over threshold amounts

- Critical requests exceeding 200% of SLA time escalate to General Manager attention
- Emergency procurement requests bypass normal SLA requirements with special authorization

#### **Financial & Business Logic Rules**

**Calculation Methods**:

*Budget Validation Processing*:
- System compares request total against available departmental budget allocation
- Hard budget limits prevent approval when allocation is exceeded without override authority
- Soft budget warnings alert approvers when 80% of allocation is reached
- Multi-period budget calculations consider fiscal year allocation and year-to-date spending

*Currency Conversion Standards*:
- Foreign currency requests convert to base currency using current exchange rates
- Exchange rate lock prevents rate fluctuation during approval processing
- Multi-currency budgets maintain separate allocation tracking by currency
- Currency conversion fees are calculated and included in total cost analysis

**Pricing Rules**:

*Market List Pricing Validation*:
- Market list items must be validated against current market pricing before approval
- Price deviations exceeding 15% from last purchase price require additional justification
- Vendor pricing must be verified through purchasing staff review process
- Emergency purchases may bypass pricing validation with appropriate authorization

*Asset Purchase Pricing Controls*:
- Asset purchases require vendor quotations and competitive bidding for amounts over 25,000 BAHT
- Capital expenditure requests must include depreciation and ROI analysis

- New fiscal year budgets reset approval thresholds and allocation limits

*Project-Based Budget Management*:
- Project-specific requests must reference valid project codes and budget allocations
- Cross-project budget transfers require project manager and Finance Manager approval
- Project completion affects remaining budget availability and approval requirements

#### **Temporal & Scheduling Rules**

**Timing Constraints**:

*Business Hours Processing*:
- Standard approval workflows operate during business hours (8 AM - 6 PM local time)
- After-hours submissions queue for next business day processing unless marked urgent
- Weekend and holiday processing is limited to emergency procurement requests
- Multi-location requests account for time zone differences in SLA calculations

*Delivery Date Validation*:
- Requested delivery dates must allow sufficient time for approval processing and vendor fulfillment
- Rush delivery requests require additional approval for associated premium costs
- Delivery scheduling must consider operational calendar and blackout periods
- Special event procurement has expedited approval processing with compressed SLA

**Date Logic**:

*Request Date Processing*:
- Request creation date establishes baseline for all SLA calculations and audit trails
- Approval dates must be sequential and cannot predate the previous stage completion
- Delivery dates cannot be earlier than minimum procurement lead time plus approval processing time
- Budget period validation ensures requests are processed within appropriate fiscal periods

**Deadline Management**:

*Critical Date Enforcement*:
- Purchase requests for scheduled events must be submitted with adequate lead time
- Month-end budget reconciliation affects approval processing for final week submissions
- Year-end requests have accelerated approval requirements to ensure processing completion
- Contract renewal requests must be submitted 30 days before expiration to ensure continuity

#### **Exception & Error Handling Rules**

**Override Conditions**:

*Emergency Procurement Authorization*:
- General Manager can authorize emergency procurement bypassing normal workflow stages
- Emergency overrides require post-procurement validation and documentation within 48 hours

**Error Recovery**:

*Workflow Correction Procedures*:
- Incorrect workflow routing can be corrected by Finance Manager with approval stage reset
- Data entry errors can be corrected by requestor during Draft status only
- Approval errors require workflow reset to previous stage with approver notification
- System errors causing workflow interruption trigger automatic escalation to system administrator

*Request Modification Process*:
- Approved requests cannot be modified without workflow reset and re-approval processing
- Minor modifications (delivery date, comments) may be allowed with approver consent
- Material changes (amount, vendor, specifications) require complete workflow restart
- Modification requests must be documented with change justification and impact analysis

**Warning Thresholds**:

*Budget and Spending Alerts*:
- Budget utilization warnings are generated at 75%, 90%, and 95% of allocation consumption
- Department spending pattern analysis triggers alerts for unusual procurement activity
- Vendor concentration warnings alert when single vendor represents over 40% of department spending
- Price variance alerts trigger when requested pricing exceeds historical averages by 20%

## Inventory Management Business Rules

### **Transaction Types**

The inventory management system supports five core transaction types:

1. **Receive Goods (IN)**: Adding inventory to the system through purchases or returns
2. **Issue Goods (OUT)**: Removing inventory for sales, consumption, or other uses
3. **Transfer Goods (TRANSFER)**: Moving inventory between locations
4. **Adjust Inventory**: Correcting inventory quantities and costs
5. **Vendor Credit Notes (Returns to Vendor)**: Returning goods to vendors

### **Costing Methods**

#### **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)**

- Each receipt creates a new cost layer
- Issues deplete layers in the order they were created
- Supports detailed cost tracking and valuation
- Provides more accurate inventory valuation in inflationary environments
- Requires more detailed record-keeping and processing

#### **Average Cost**

- Calculates a new average cost with each receipt
- All issues use the current average cost
- Simplifies cost tracking but may be less precise for individual transactions
- Reduces the complexity of inventory valuation
- Requires less detailed record-keeping than FIFO
- May be more appropriate for commodities or items with minimal cost variations

### **Receive Goods (IN) Process Rules**

**Process Flow**:
1. Create entry in ReceiveGoods table
2. For each item received:
   - Create entry in ReceiveGoodsDetails table
   - Create entry in InventoryTransactions table (StockMovement = 'IN')
   - Apply costing method:
     - **If FIFO**: Create new entry in FIFOCostLayers table
     - **If Average**: Calculate new average cost and create entry in AverageCostTracking table
   - Update InventoryStatus table (increase QuantityOnHand, update costs)
3. Update total quantity and cost in ReceiveGoods table

**Edit and Delete Rules**:
- **Editability Check**: Verify if any items from this receipt have been issued or transferred
- If items have been used: Prevent editing/deletion and inform the user
- **Reversal Process**: Create reversal entries to undo effects before applying new values
- **FIFO Adjustment**: Remove or adjust the corresponding FIFOCostLayer
- **Average Cost Recalculation**: Recalculate average cost after reversal

### **Issue Goods (OUT) Process Rules**

**Process Flow**:
1. Create entry in Issues table
2. For each item issued:
   - Create entry in IssueDetails table
   - Create entry in InventoryTransactions table (StockMovement = 'OUT')
   - Apply costing method:
     - **If FIFO**: Identify and update FIFOCostLayers (start with oldest layer, move to newer as needed)
     - **If Average**: Use current average cost from latest AverageCostTracking entry
   - Update InventoryStatus table (decrease QuantityOnHand, update costs)
3. Update total quantity and cost in Issues table

### **Transfer Goods (TRANSFER) Process Rules**

**Process Flow**:
1. Create entry in Transfers table
2. For each item transferred:
   - Create entry in TransferDetails table
   - Create two entries in InventoryTransactions table (OUT from source, IN to destination)
   - Apply costing method:
     - **If FIFO**: Update source FIFO layers, create destination FIFO layers
     - **If Average**: Use source average cost, create/update destination average cost
   - Update InventoryStatus table for both locations (decrease source, increase destination)
3. Update total quantity in Transfers table

### **Adjust Inventory Process Rules**

**Process Flow**:
1. Create entry in Adjustments table
2. For each item adjusted:
   - Create entry in AdjustmentDetails table
   - Create entry in InventoryTransactions table (StockMovement = 'IN' for positive, 'OUT' for negative)
   - Apply costing method:
     - **If FIFO**: Create new layer (positive) or update existing layers (negative)
     - **If Average**: Calculate new average cost (positive) or use current average cost (negative)
   - Update InventoryStatus table (adjust QuantityOnHand, update costs)
3. Update total quantity in Adjustments table

### **Vendor Credit Notes (Returns to Vendor) Process Rules**

**Process Flow**:
1. Create entry in VendorCreditNotes table
2. For each item being returned:
   - Create entry in VendorCreditNoteDetails table
   - Create entry in InventoryTransactions table (TransactionType = 'VendorReturn', StockMovement = 'OUT')
   - Apply costing method:
     - **If FIFO**: Match to original receipt layer if possible, otherwise use most recent layers
     - **If Average**: Use current average cost, recalculate after removal
   - Update InventoryStatus table (decrease QuantityOnHand, update costs)
3. Update total quantity and amount in VendorCreditNotes table
4. Create payable or offset against existing payables to the vendor
5. Update financial records or journals to reflect the return and credit

### **Implementation Considerations**

**Data Integrity**:
- Robust error handling and transaction management
- Database constraints and validation rules
- Comprehensive audit trails for all inventory transactions

**Performance Optimization**:
- Proper indexing on frequently queried fields
- Partitioning for large transaction tables
- Optimized queries for high-volume operations

**Transaction Volume Management**:
- Scalability for high transaction volumes
- Impact assessment on FIFO layer updates
- Batch processing for bulk operations

**Security and Access Control**:
- Role-based access controls
- Approval hierarchies for critical transactions
- Proper segregation of duties

**System Integration**:
- Integration with purchasing, sales, and finance systems
- Robust API interfaces for external systems
- Real-time or near-real-time data synchronization
