# Goods Receiving Process Documentation

## Overview

The Goods Receiving Process is designed to efficiently manage the receipt of goods from vendors, allowing users to select multiple purchase orders, choose specific items to be received, and generate Goods Receiving Notes (GRNs). The system supports receiving items from the same PO into different locations and allows for flexible item selection.

## Process Start Options

Users can initiate the goods receiving process in two ways:

### Option 1: PO-Based Receiving (Standard Flow)
Start by selecting vendors and POs, then proceed to item selection and GRN generation. This is the standard flow for receiving goods that were previously ordered through the system.

### Option 2: Manual GRN Creation
Create a GRN manually without referencing existing POs. This option is useful for:
- Receiving unplanned deliveries
- Processing returns
- Handling goods that were not ordered through the system
- Creating adjustments or corrections

## Complete Process Flow

**PO-Based Flow:**
1. **Vendor Selection** → 2. **PO Selection** → 3. **Item & Location Selection** → 4. **GRN Confirmation**

## Responsive Behavior

The UI is designed to adapt to different screen sizes:

- **Desktop/Large Screens:** Full layout as described above
- **Tablet:** Column widths adjust, navigation may collapse to icons
- **Mobile:** Stacked layout with collapsible sections, reduced table columns

## Technical Notes

- The system supports two distinct starting points for goods receiving
- Location information is stored at the item level, not the PO level
- Each PO can have items going to different locations
- The UI groups items by location for intuitive receiving
- The interface allows for filtering by location to simplify the receiving process
- Manual GRN creation bypasses the PO verification but still updates inventory
- Both flows result in the same GRN format and inventory updates

## User Permission Requirements

- View Vendors
- View Purchase Orders
- Create Goods Receiving Notes
- Update Inventory
- Manual GRN Creation (may be a separate permission)

## System Integrations

- Inventory Management System
- Purchase Order System
- Vendor Management

- User Authentication and Permission System

## Process Decision Points

1. **Initial Process Selection:**
   - PO-Based: When receiving goods that match existing purchase orders
   - Manual: When receiving unplanned deliveries or making inventory adjustments

2. **Location Selection (PO-Based flow):**
   - Users can choose which locations to receive items into
   - This filters the items shown to only those for selected locations

3. **Item Selection:**
   - Items can be individually selected or deselected
   - Quantities can be adjusted to handle partial deliveries

4. **GRN Finalization:**
   - Review before confirmation
