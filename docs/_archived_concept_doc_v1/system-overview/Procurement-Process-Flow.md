## Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the end-to-end procurement process within the Carmen F&B Management System, detailing how the Purchase Request (PR), Purchase Order (PO), Goods Received Note (GRN), and Credit Note (CN) modules interact to form a complete procurement lifecycle.

## Procurement Lifecycle Overview
The procurement process follows a standard lifecycle:
1. **Need Identification**: A need is identified and a Purchase Request is created
2. **Approval Process**: The PR goes through an approval workflow
3. **Vendor Selection**: Approved vendors are selected and a Purchase Order is created
4. **Order Fulfillment**: The vendor fulfills the order
5. **Goods Receipt**: Goods are received and a GRN is created
6. **Invoice Processing**: Invoices are processed and payments are made
7. **Returns/Credits**: If needed, returns are processed and credit notes are issued

## Module Interactions

### PR to PO Conversion
The conversion from Purchase Request (PR) to Purchase Order (PO) is a critical process that ensures traceability throughout the procurement lifecycle. This section details how PR items are converted to PO items and how the relationship between them is maintained.

#### Conversion Process

1. **PR Approval**: Only approved PRs can be converted to POs
2. **Conversion Methods**:
   - **Full Conversion**: All items from a PR are converted to a single PO
   - **Partial Conversion**: Selected items from a PR are converted to a PO
   - **Split Conversion**: Items from a PR are split across multiple POs
   - **Consolidated Conversion**: Items from multiple PRs are consolidated into a single PO

3. **Data Mapping**:

| PR Item Field | PO Item Field | Transformation Rule |
|---------------|---------------|---------------------|
| item_id | item_id | Direct mapping |
| description | description | Direct mapping |
| quantity_requested | quantity_ordered | Direct mapping |
| unit | unit | Direct mapping |
| estimated_price | price | Updated with actual vendor price |
| delivery_date | delivery_date | May be adjusted based on vendor terms |
| pr_id | source_pr_id | Reference to source PR |
| pr_item_id | source_pr_item_id | Reference to source PR item |
| status | - | Not mapped (PO has its own status) |

4. **Traceability Links**:
   - Each PO item maintains references to its source PR and PR item
   - The PR item status is updated to reflect its conversion to a PO
   - Bidirectional links allow navigation from PR to PO and vice versa

#### Conversion Rules

1. **Quantity Rules**:
   - PO quantity cannot exceed PR approved quantity
   - PR items can be partially converted (some quantity to one PO, remaining to another)
   - System tracks remaining quantity to be converted

2. **Vendor Rules**:
   - PR may suggest vendors, but final vendor selection happens during PO creation
   - Multiple vendors may be selected for different items from the same PR
   - Vendor-specific pricing overrides estimated PR pricing

3. **Status Updates**:
   - PR items status updated to "In Progress" when partially converted
   - PR items status updated to "Converted" when fully converted
   - PR status updated to "Partially Converted" or "Fully Converted" based on items

#### Traceability Queries

The system supports the following traceability queries:

1. **Forward Traceability**:
   - For a given PR, find all POs created from it
   - For a given PR item, find all PO items created from it

2. **Backward Traceability**:
   - For a given PO, find all source PRs
   - For a given PO item, find the source PR item

3. **Full Lifecycle Traceability**:
   - For a given PR, trace through POs to GRNs and CNs
   - For a given PR item, trace through PO items to GRN items and CN items

#### Conversion UI

The PO creation interface provides the following features for PR conversion:

1. **PR Selection**: Ability to select one or more approved PRs
2. **Item Selection**: Ability to select specific items from selected PRs
3. **Quantity Adjustment**: Ability to adjust quantities (within approved limits)
4. **Vendor Assignment**: Ability to assign vendors to items
5. **Price Update**: Ability to update prices based on vendor quotes
6. **Delivery Schedule**: Ability to adjust delivery dates

#### Reporting

The system provides the following reports for PR-to-PO traceability:

1. **PR Conversion Status Report**: Shows conversion status of all PRs
2. **PO Source Report**: Shows source PRs for all POs
3. **Item Traceability Report**: Shows the full lifecycle of items from PR to PO to GRN to CN

### PO to GRN Relationship

The relationship between Purchase Orders (PO) and Goods Received Notes (GRN) is fundamental to the procurement process, enabling accurate tracking of ordered versus received goods.

#### Key Aspects of PO-GRN Relationship

1. **Reference Integrity**:
   - Each GRN must reference a valid PO
   - Multiple GRNs can be created against a single PO (partial deliveries)
   - GRN items must reference specific PO items

2. **Data Mapping**:

| PO Item Field | GRN Item Field | Transformation Rule |
|---------------|----------------|---------------------|
| po_id | source_po_id | Direct reference |
| po_item_id | source_po_item_id | Direct reference |
| item_id | item_id | Direct mapping |
| description | description | Direct mapping |
| quantity_ordered | expected_quantity | Direct mapping |
| unit | unit | Direct mapping |
| price | unit_price | Direct mapping |
| - | quantity_received | New field in GRN |
| - | quantity_accepted | New field in GRN |
| - | quantity_rejected | New field in GRN |

3. **Quantity Tracking**:
   - System tracks ordered, received, accepted, and rejected quantities
   - Partial receipts are supported (receiving less than ordered quantity)
   - Over-receipts can be allowed or restricted based on configuration
   - Remaining quantities to be received are calculated and displayed

4. **Status Management**:
   - PO status is updated based on GRN creation
   - PO items can be in different states (fully received, partially received, not received)
   - PO can be closed when all items are fully received or when explicitly marked as complete

#### GRN Creation Process

1. **GRN Initiation**:
   - User selects a PO to receive against
   - System loads PO details and outstanding items
   - User can choose to receive all or selected items

2. **Quantity Verification**:
   - User enters received quantities for each item
   - System validates against ordered quantities
   - Discrepancies are highlighted and may require approval

3. **Quality Inspection**:
   - Received items can undergo quality inspection
   - Quantities can be split into accepted and rejected
   - Rejected items can trigger Credit Note creation

4. **Inventory Update**:
   - Accepted quantities update inventory levels
   - Lot/batch tracking information is recorded
   - Storage locations are assigned

5. **Financial Processing**:
   - GRN generates financial entries
   - Accruals are created for received goods
   - Tax calculations are performed

#### Reporting and Analytics

1. **Receipt Status Report**: Shows receipt status of all POs
2. **Delivery Performance Report**: Analyzes vendor delivery performance
3. **Receipt Variance Report**: Highlights discrepancies between ordered and received quantities

### GRN to CN Relationship

The relationship between Goods Received Notes (GRN) and Credit Notes (CN) enables the management of returns, rejections, and financial adjustments in the procurement process.

#### Key Aspects of GRN-CN Relationship

1. **Reference Integrity**:
   - Each CN must reference a valid GRN
   - Multiple CNs can be created against a single GRN
   - CN items must reference specific GRN items

2. **Data Mapping**:

| GRN Item Field | CN Item Field | Transformation Rule |
|----------------|---------------|---------------------|
| grn_id | source_grn_id | Direct reference |
| grn_item_id | source_grn_item_id | Direct reference |
| po_id | po_id | Indirect reference through GRN |
| po_item_id | po_item_id | Indirect reference through GRN |
| item_id | item_id | Direct mapping |
| description | description | Direct mapping |
| quantity_accepted | max_returnable_quantity | Calculated field |
| unit_price | unit_price | Direct mapping |
| - | return_quantity | New field in CN |
| - | return_reason | New field in CN |

3. **Return Quantity Management**:
   - System enforces that return quantities cannot exceed received quantities
   - Partial returns are supported
   - Multiple returns against the same GRN item are tracked cumulatively

4. **Financial Implications**:
   - CN generates financial entries to reverse GRN entries
   - Tax adjustments are calculated
   - Credit amounts are applied to vendor accounts

5. **Inventory Adjustments**:
   - Returned quantities reduce inventory levels
   - Lot/batch tracking is maintained for returns
   - FIFO/LIFO/Average cost calculations are adjusted

#### CN Creation Process

    PR[Purchase Request] -->|creates| PRI[PR Items]
    PRI -->|converts to| POI[PO Items]
    POI -->|belongs to| PO[Purchase Order]
    POI -->|receives as| GRNI[GRN Items]
    GRNI -->|belongs to| GRN[Goods Received Note]
    GRNI -->|returns as| CNI[CN Items]
    CNI -->|belongs to| CN[Credit Note]
    
    classDef document fill:#D6EBFC,stroke:#324B4B,stroke-width:1px,color:black
    classDef item fill:#FFF0D4,stroke:#324B4B,stroke-width:1px,color:black
    
    class PR,PO,GRN,CN document
    class PRI,POI,GRNI,CNI item
```

### Data Transformation

As data moves through the procurement lifecycle, it undergoes various transformations:

1. **PR to PO Transformation**:
   - Estimated prices become actual vendor prices
   - Requested quantities may be adjusted based on vendor MOQs
   - Delivery dates are finalized based on vendor commitments
   - Additional vendor-specific information is added

2. **PO to GRN Transformation**:
   - Ordered quantities are compared to received quantities
   - Actual receipt dates are recorded
   - Quality inspection results are added
   - Storage locations and lot information are assigned

3. **GRN to CN Transformation**:
   - Received quantities become returnable quantities
   - Return reasons and conditions are added
   - Return authorization information is included
   - Credit amounts and adjustments are calculated

### Data Integrity Rules

To maintain data integrity across the procurement lifecycle, the following rules are enforced:

1. **Quantity Rules**:
   - PO quantities cannot exceed PR approved quantities
   - GRN quantities cannot exceed PO quantities (unless over-receipt is allowed)
   - CN quantities cannot exceed GRN accepted quantities

2. **Reference Integrity**:
   - Each PO item maintains reference to its source PR item (if applicable)
   - Each GRN item must reference a valid PO item
   - Each CN item must reference a valid GRN item

3. **Status Synchronization**:
   - PR status is updated based on PO creation status
   - PO status is updated based on GRN creation status
   - GRN status is updated based on CN creation status

4. **Financial Consistency**:
   - Financial calculations must be consistent across modules
   - Currency conversions must use appropriate exchange rates
   - Tax calculations must follow consistent rules

## Status Transitions

Status transitions across modules ensure proper workflow management and provide visibility into the procurement lifecycle.

### Cross-Module Status Dependencies

The status of documents in one module can affect the available actions in another module:

1. **PR Status Impact**:
   - Only approved PRs can be converted to POs
   - Rejected PRs cannot be converted to POs
   - PRs under revision cannot be converted to POs

2. **PO Status Impact**:
   - Only approved POs can have GRNs created against them
   - Closed POs cannot have new GRNs created
   - Cancelled POs cannot have GRNs created

3. **GRN Status Impact**:
   - Only approved GRNs can have CNs created against them
   - GRNs with pending quality checks cannot have CNs created
   - Fully returned GRNs cannot have additional CNs created

### Status Synchronization

Status changes in one document can trigger status updates in related documents:

1. **PO Creation Impact on PR**:
   - When all PR items are converted to POs, PR status changes to "Fully Converted"
   - When some PR items are converted to POs, PR status changes to "Partially Converted"

2. **GRN Creation Impact on PO**:
   - When all PO items are fully received, PO status changes to "Fully Received"
   - When some PO items are received, PO status changes to "Partially Received"

3. **CN Creation Impact on GRN**:
   - When all GRN items are fully returned, GRN status changes to "Fully Returned"
   - When some GRN items are returned, GRN status changes to "Partially Returned"
